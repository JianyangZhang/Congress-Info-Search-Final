Included among child care assistance to be provided under this bill are:  a stipend for the payment of the full cost of child care offered by a licensed child care center, which shall be modeled after the VA's Child Care Subsidy Program; direct provision of child care at an on-site VA facility; a payment made directly to a private child care agency; and  collaboration with a facility or program of another federal department or agency.
