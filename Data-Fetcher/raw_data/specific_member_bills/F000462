Defines a \"Veteran Student Center\" as a dedicated space on a campus that provides students who are veterans or members of the Armed Forces with: (1) a lounge or meeting space for themselves, their spouses or partners, and veterans in the community; (2) a centralized office for veteran services that is staffed by trained employees and volunteers and serves as a single point of contact to coordinate veterans support services; and (3) comprehensive academic and tutoring services to veterans. Requires that office to provide such students with assistance in:  transitioning from the military to student life, transitioning from the military to the civilian workforce,  networking with other veteran students and veterans in the community,  understanding and obtaining benefits provided by the IHE and federal and state government for which they may be eligible,  understanding how to succeed in the IHE, and understanding their disability-related rights and protections under specified federal laws.

Prescribes requirements for the designation of new and consolidation of multiple MPOs within a metropolitan statistical area. Defines \"consolidated metropolitan planning organization\" to mean a sole MPO that serves a metropolitan statistical area. Allows an MPO for an urbanized area with a population over 200,000 to request a high-performing MPO designation from the Department of Transportation (DOT). Specifies criteria DOT shall consider in making such designation.  Revises certain allocations of surface transportation program funds to states for:    any areas with a population of fewer (under current law, non-urban areas with more) than 5,000, and   urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 that have a high-performing MPO.  Makes similar changes to the transportation alternatives program. Extends permanently a state's obligational authority to distribute a specified amount of surface transportation program funds for federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000, including those areas that have a high-performing MPO. Makes permanent a special rule authorizing a state to obligate up to 15% of its apportionment of surface transportation program funds for each fiscal on roads functionally classified as minor collectors in areas of less than 5,000 population. Revises requirements for the apportionment of state planning funds to MPOs. Requires a state's apportionment to be distributed in accordance with a formula that prioritizes the needs of high-performing MPOs. Requires metropolitan planning organizations to involve public port authorities in metropolitan freight transportation planning. Revises the statewide and nonmetropolitan transportation planning process for the development of statewide transportation plans and statewide transportation improvement programs for federal-aid highway projects. Makes certain changes from discretionary to mandatory with respect to such process. Requires DOT to certify at least once every four years that each state has met certain requirements; and other federal laws, regulations, and orders applicable to the statewide and nonmetropolitan and the metropolitan processes. Authorizes DOT to withhold up to 20% of a state's apportionment of funds for federal-aid highway projects and public transportation projects if the state fails to meet such certification. Makes similar changes to requirements for public transportation program projects. Eliminates the requirement that the congestion management process be addressed in the metropolitan transportation planning and statewide and nonmetropolitan transportation planning of such projects in:  urbanized transportation management areas with a population over 200,000 individuals, and  certain nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide.  Revises requirements authorizing an MPO to voluntarily elect to develop multiple scenarios for consideration as part of the development of the metropolitan transportation plan for a metropolitan planning area. Requires an MPO to offer certain interested parties a reasonable opportunity to participate in the development and consideration of those scenarios as well as provide input during the development and implementation of the transportation plan.
