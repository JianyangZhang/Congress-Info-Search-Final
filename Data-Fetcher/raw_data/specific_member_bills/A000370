The bill increases the minimum SNAP benefit and requires benefits to be calculated using a low-cost food plan. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) must determine the requirements for the low-cost food plan, which is the diet required to feed a family of four, consisting of:  a man and a woman 19-50 years of age,  a child 6-8 years of age, and  a child 9-11 years of age.   USDA must make adjustments to the plan to account for household size, changes in the cost of the diet, and the costs of food in specified areas.  The bill revises the amounts authorized for nutrition assistance block grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa and requires the amounts to be modified based on adjustments to the low-cost food plan.

The Department of Agriculture (USDA) must determine the requirements for the low-cost food plan, which is the diet required to feed a family of four, consisting of:  a man and a woman 19-50 years of age,  a child 6-8 years of age, and  a child 9-11 years of age.   USDA must make adjustments to the plan to account for household size, changes in the cost of the diet, and the costs of food in specified areas.  The bill revises the amounts authorized for nutrition assistance block grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa and requires the amounts to be modified based on adjustments to the low-cost food plan.  The bill modifies the requirements for calculating household income to determine SNAP eligibility by: (1) authorizing a standard medical expense deduction for households containing an elderly or disabled member, and (2) eliminating the cap on the deduction for excess shelter expenses.  The bill exempts from SNAP work requirements able-bodied adults without dependents who are not offered a position in a SNAP Employment and Training Program. ",
