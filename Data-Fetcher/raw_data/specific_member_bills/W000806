The Council shall:   develop a strategic plan that identifies federal agency roles and responsibilities and measurable outcomes in coordinating such services;  develop a joint cost-sharing policy among federal agencies with representatives on the Council that provides clear guidance to state and local governments regarding cost allocation;  maintain an inventory of all federal programs that provide such services; and  partner with State Transport Coordinating Commissions (STCCs) and aid them in coordinating such services.  A state must establish an STCC to coordinate transportation for transportation-disadvantaged individuals. An STCC shall:  compile information on transportation operations for and needs of such individuals;  establish statewide objectives for coordinating transportation services for such individuals;  develop written policies and procedures for the coordination of government funding for such individuals;  identify and pursue the elimination of barriers to transportation services;  establish an information clearinghouse;  assist communities in developing transportation systems designed to serve such individuals;  verify that purchasing procedures aid the coordination of such services;  verify that purchasing agencies purchase all trips within transportation systems that serve such individuals, unless they use more cost-effective alternative providers; and  develop a strategic plan that addresses the transportation problems and needs of such individuals over a five-year period.  DOT must withhold 1% of the amount required to be apportioned to a state under specified federal-aid highway programs on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with FY2017 if the state does not meet this bill's requirements.
