The bill also revises penalty and transparency requirements and eliminates the H-1B-dependent employer category. The Department of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an employer's: (1) failure to meet an application condition, or (2) misrepresentation of material facts in an application. No nonimmigrant foreign student present in the United States may be provided U.S. employment authorization under the optional practical training program without an express Act of Congress authorizing such program. An employer may not require a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident employee to sign any nondisparagement or nondisclosure agreement that conditions receipt of any financial or nonfinancial benefit from the employer upon the nondisclosure of the employer's potential misuse of the H-1B visa program.  A U.S. district court shall have jurisdiction to address civil actions by any person claiming H-1B program misuse. A U.S. court of appeals shall have jurisdiction over related appeals for cases originating from a U.S. district court within that circuit. The Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to address appeals of civil actions by any person claiming H-1B program misuse for cases originating from any U.S. court of appeals. The bill eliminates the diversity visa lottery program.",

The bill also revises penalty and transparency requirements, and eliminates the H-1B-dependent employer category. The Department of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an employer's: (1) failure to meet an application condition, or (2) misrepresentation of material facts in an application. No nonimmigrant foreign student present in the United States may be provided U.S. employment authorization under the optional practical training program (or any successor program) without an express Act of Congress authorizing such a program.  An H-1B nonimmigrant must have a doctorate or post-doctorate degree, or the foreign equivalent of such a degree.  A nonimmigrant with an undergraduate degree or a combination of undergraduate and masters degrees (or the foreign equivalents) must have at least 10 years of relevant post-degree experience for program eligibility. The bill gives employment placement priority to a nonimmigrant with one or more doctorate or post-doctorate degrees from a U.S.-based university.  Foreign educational institutions must have educational standards certification from Labor.  An employer may not require a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident employee to sign any nondisparagement or nondisclosure agreement that conditions receipt of any financial or nonfinancial benefit from the employer upon the nondisclosure of the employer's potential misuse of the H-1B visa program.  A U.S. district court shall have jurisdiction to address civil actions by any person claiming H-1B program misuse. A U.S. court of appeals shall have jurisdiction over related appeals for cases originating from a U.S. district court within that circuit. The Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to address appeals of civil actions by any person claiming H-1B program misuse for cases originating from any U.S. court of appeals. The bill eliminates the diversity visa lottery program.",

Declares that it is the intent of Congress that funds authorized to be appropriated for covered programs be applied in meeting established technical goals and schedule milestones. Declares void and unenforceable any provision in a prime contract entered into before enactment of this Act that provides for the payment of termination liability costs through any other means than as provided in this Act. Bars the Administrator from initiating termination of a prime contract on a covered program for the convenience of the government unless it is authorized or required by a law enacted after this Act's enactment. Requires notice to specified congressional committees before initiating termination of a prime contract for cause.  Requires the Administrator to notify Congress if an authorization of appropriations is necessary in advance of a proposed program termination because sufficient unobligated appropriations are not available in the appropriations account funding the contract.
