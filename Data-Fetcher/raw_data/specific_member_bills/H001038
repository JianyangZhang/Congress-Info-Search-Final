Child care assistance under this bill includes:  stipends for the payment of child care offered by licensed child care centers which shall be modeled after the VA's Child Care Subsidy Program, direct provision of child care at an on-site VA facility, payments to private child care agencies, and  collaboration with facilities or programs of other federal agencies.

The EPA must give priority to facilities at which nutrient removal technology installations would: (1) produce the greatest nutrient load reductions at points of discharge, (2) result in the greatest environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and (3) help meet the objectives related to nutrients outlined in Annex 4 of the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.",
