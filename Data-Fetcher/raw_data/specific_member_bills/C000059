(Sec. 5) The bill confirms water rights that must be held in trust by the United States on behalf of the tribe and its allottees. (Allottees are individuals who hold a beneficial real property interest in an Indian allotment that is located within the reservation and held in trust by the United States.) Allotted land is entitled to a just and equitable allocation of water from the water rights for irrigation and domestic purposes. Allottees may lease their land together with any water right. The tribe must enact a Pechanga Water Code that governs the storage, recovery, and use of the water rights, subject to the Department of the Interior's approval. Interior must administer the water rights until the water code is enacted and approved. (Sec. 7) The tribe and the United States (acting as trustee for the tribe and allottees) must waive all claims to water rights within the Santa Margarita River Watershed, except water rights recognized in the Pechanga Settlement Agreement and this bill. The tribe and the United States (acting as trustee for the tribe) waive specified claims against the RCWD. The tribe may waive claims against the United States regarding specified water rights and damages.   The waivers in this bill are enforceable on the date Interior publishes specified findings regarding deposits, waivers, and approved agreements.  (Sec. 8) Interior must provide the amounts necessary to fulfill the tribe's obligations under specified agreements regarding water infrastructure.  (Sec. 9) The bill establishes the Pechanga Settlement Fund. The fund is to be used to carry out this bill. (Sec. 12) If Interior does not publish the findings required for enforcement of the waivers in this bill by April 30, 2021, or an alternative later date agreed to by the tribe and Interior, the provisions of this bill expire, related agreements are void, and funds are rescinded.",

The bill provides annual appropriations for most of the Department of the Interior, including:    the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS),   the National Park Service (NPS),   the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),   the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,   the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement,   the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement,   the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT),   the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and   the Bureau of Indian Education.   It does not include funding for the Bureau of Reclamation, which is considered in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.  Related agencies funded in the bill include the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service (IHS), the Smithsonian Institution, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The bill decreases appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies below FY2016 levels. Compared to FY2016 funding levels, the bill increases funding for Interior, the IHS, and the Smithsonian Institution, while decreasing funding for the EPA and the Forest Service.  Within the Interior budget, the bill increases funding for the NPS, the USGS, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Education. The bill decreases funding for the BLM and the USFWS.   The bill also includes several provisions that affect policies in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, air and water quality, endangered species, and water policy in California.
