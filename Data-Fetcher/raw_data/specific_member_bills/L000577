(Offsetting receipts and collections are funds collected by agencies from other government accounts or from the public in businesslike or market-oriented transactions. Under current law, the collections are treated as negative budget authority and outlays rather than revenue and may be used to offset spending for budget enforcement purposes.)  The requirements of the bill do not apply to the U.S. Postal Service or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
