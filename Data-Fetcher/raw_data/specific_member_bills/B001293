Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill prohibits the wages or other remuneration earned by an employee who performs employment duties in more than one state from being subject to income tax in any state other than: (1) the state of the employee's residence, and (2) the state within which the employee is present and performing employment duties for more than 30 days during the calendar year in which the wages or other remuneration is earned.  The bill exempts employers from state income tax withholding and information reporting requirements for employees not subject to income tax in the state under this bill. For the purposes of determining penalties related to an employer's state income tax withholding or reporting requirements, an employer may rely on an employee's annual determination of the time expected to be spent working in a state in the absence of fraud or collusion by such employee. For the purposes of this bill, the term \"employee\" excludes: professional athletes; professional entertainers; production employees who perform services in connection with certain film, television, or other commercial video productions; and public figures who are persons of prominence who perform services for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.  (Sec. 3) The bill takes effect on January 1 of the second calendar year that begins after the enactment of this bill. The bill does not apply to any tax obligation that accrues before the effective date.",

Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2015 (Sec.2) This bill prohibits the wages or other remuneration earned by an employee who performs employment duties in more than one state from being subject to income tax in any state other than: (1) the state of the employee's residence, and (2) the state within which the employee is present and performing employment duties for more than 30 days during the calendar year.  The bill also exempts employers from state income tax withholding and information reporting requirements for employees not subject to income tax under this bill.  For the purpose of determining penalties related to employer withholding or reporting requirements, an employer may rely on an employee's annual determination of the time such employee will spend working in a state in the absence of fraud or collusion by such employee.  The bill exempts from the definition of \"employee\" professional athletes, professional entertainers, and public figures who are persons of prominence who perform services for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis. (Sec. 3) The bill takes effect on January 1 of the second year that begins after the date of the enactment of this bill. ",

A student must first exhaust Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loan eligibility.  IHEs may continue to disburse Perkins Loans to current undergraduate borrowers through September 30, 2017. A student must first exhaust all Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan eligibility. IHEs may continue to disburse Perkins Loans to certain graduate borrowers through September 30, 2016, to enable students to continue or complete an academic program. A student must have received a Perkins loan prior to October 1, 2015.  The bill prohibits Perkins Loan disbursement beyond September 30, 2017.  It also prohibits authorization of additional appropriations for the Federal Perkins Loan program beyond September 30, 2016.  Beginning October 1, 2017, each participating IHE must pay to the Department of Education: (1) a portion of the federal share of the balance of its Perkins Loan funds; (2) a portion of the Perkins student loan payments, including principal and interest, received by the institution; and (3) a capital distribution from its Perkins Loan fund.  (Sec. 3) The bill also expands disclosure requirements for IHEs that participate in the Federal Perkins Loan program.  Specifically, prior to Perkins Loan disbursement, an IHE must provide notice and explanation to all borrowers regarding unavailability of future Perkins loans, limited Perkins loan repayment and forgiveness options, and Direct Loan consolidation options. Also, an IHE must provide notice and explanation to new and current undergraduate borrowers regarding a comparison of Perkins and Direct loan interest rates.  ",
