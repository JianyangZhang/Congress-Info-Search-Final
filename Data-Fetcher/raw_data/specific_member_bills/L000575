The definition of \"rule\" under the RFA is expanded to include all agency rules, except for: (1) rules that pertain to the protection of the rights of and benefits for veterans or that impose limitations on the cost and terms of consumer credit extended to service members and their dependents, or (2) rules of particular (and not general) applicability relating to rates, wages, and other financial indicators. Under a new definition of \"economic impact,\" agencies are required to consider any direct economic effect of a proposed rule on small entities and any indirect economic effect on small entities that is reasonably foreseeable and that results from such rule.  Under the bill, agencies are required to modify their rulemaking procedures to:   include within initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses a detailed statement of information relating to a proposed rule;  include in the agency regulatory flexibility agenda a description of the sector of the North American Industrial Classification System that is affected by a proposed agency rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact of a substantial number of small entities;  require each initial regulatory flexibility analysis to contain detailed information about a proposed rule, including why agency action is being considered, the objectives and legal basis for the proposed rule, and an estimate of the number and types of small entities to which the proposed rule will apply;  eliminate waivers or delays of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis;  modify the procedures for participation of small entities in the promulgation of a proposed rule and the review panel advocacy process; and  publish a plan for the periodic review of existing rules and new rules that have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities to determine whether such rules should be continued, changed, or rescinded.  Judicial review of an agency final rule for compliance with RFA requirements is allowed after the publication of such rule, instead of after completion of the rulemaking process. The Small Business Act is amended to authorize the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make small business size-standard determinations for all purposes other than for the purposes of such Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. SBREFA is amended to require agencies, in preparing small entity compliance guides, to solicit input from affected small entities or associations of small entities.  The Government Accountability Office must complete and publish a study that examines whether the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy has the capacity and resources to carry out duties under this bill.  An agency may not impose a civil fine on a small business for a violation of the agency's information collection requirements if the small business has not previously violated a similar requirement during the preceding five years, unless there is: (1) a potential for serious harm to the public interest; (2) an impediment to detection of criminal activity; (3) a violation of an internal revenue law or a law concerning the assessment or collection of any tax, debt, revenue, or receipt; (4) a violation that is not corrected within six months; or (5) a danger to public health or safety, subject to a possible exception if the violation is corrected within 24 hours. The agency shall not take into account a small business's violation of another agency's information collection requirements. ",

Considers any willful neglect or refusal to make and file proper accountings or reports concerning such payments as required by law to be prima facie evidence of the embezzlement or prohibited conversion of such amounts.  Prohibits OPM from authorizing a person to receive payments on behalf of a minor or individual of legal disability if that person has been convicted of: (1) a violation of this Act, (2) fraud under the Social Security Act, or (3) misappropriation as a fiduciary under veterans' benefits provisions.",

                "summary": "Grant Reform and New Transparency Act of 2016 or the GRANT Act (Sec. 2) This bill requires an executive agency, before awarding a competitive grant and after determining eligibility and conducting a merit-based review, to conduct an evaluation of the risk posed by an applicant to successfully carry out the grant. The evaluation shall include a review of any interagency duplication of efforts for research grants. In conducting the evaluation with respect to an applicant that is determined to pose a relatively low risk of failing to execute the grant successfully, an executive agency shall: (1) minimize the burden on the applicant, and (2) consider any existing findings with respect to such applicant under the single audit process. The bill directs the Office of Management and Budget to consult with executive agencies to upgrade grants.gov or any successor public website for finding and applying for federal grants so that the website: (1) serves as a central point of information on, and provides full access for applicants to, competitive grants; and (2) captures in one site, or provides electronic links to, other relevant databases. Executive agencies issuing a solicitation for or announcing the availability of competitive grants shall post on such website: (1) specified information about the grant opportunity, (2) detailed grant guidance and written technical assistance for applicants, and (3) selection documentation and justification. Agencies may redact personally identifiable information from a post on the website and must exclude sensitive information that would adversely affect an applicant.  The bill requires each agency to post a forecast of all non-emergency grant solicitations that it expects to issue for the upcoming calendar year.  The grants website shall:   make the required information available in its original format without charge or a license or registration requirement;  permit the information to be searched, downloaded in bulk, disseminated via automatic electronic means, and freely shared by the public;  use permanent uniform resource locators for the information; and  provide an opportunity for the public to provide input about the usefulness of the site and recommendations for improvements.  Upon an applicant's request, an agency must explain the basis for an award decision of a grant exceeding $100,000 pursuant to a merit-based selection procedure. Agency inspectors general shall review the effectiveness of an agency's conflicts of interest policy with respect to the peer review process for competitive grants in order to detect favoritism. (Sec. 3) The Government Accountability Office shall report on: (1) the size and training of the federal grants workforce and recommendations for improving it, (2) whether a warrant system similar to that used in the federal acquisition system should be established for federal officials authorized to award grants, and (3) agency use of suspension and debarment actions against grantees during the previous three years and the level of agency resources assigned to suspension and debarment functions.",
