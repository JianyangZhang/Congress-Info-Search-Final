The bill amends the San Luis Act (the 1960 statute that authorized Interior to construct the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project [CVP], California) to: (1) repeal provisions that include distribution systems or drains within the Westlands Water District, and (2) eliminate requirements for Interior to meet drainage requirements for Westlands.  Interior shall:   convert Westlands' existing long-term or interim renewal water service contract to a repayment contract,  make allocation decisions in the CVP affecting Westlands consistent with federal and state law, and  enter into a contract with the Navy for the delivery of CVP water to the Lemoore Naval Air Station.  The bill suspends Westlands' capital repayment obligation and payments under its water service contracts and the April 1, 1965, repayment contract with the United States until the execution of a repayment contract under this bill, after which Westlands shall: (1) receive a specified credit against future operation and maintenance costs payable to the United States, and (2) be relieved of capital repayment obligations under specified water service contracts. CVP construction costs or other capitalized costs allocated to the Westlands after the date of the Westlands Agreement shall be repaid within five years after notification of the allocation of less than $5 million. If the amount allocated is $5 million or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable reclamation law.  The bill requires Interior to transfer title to specified facilities to Westlands upon the execution of the repayment contracts under this bill. For any year in which the allocation of water for south-of-Delta CVP long-term water irrigation service contractors or irrigation repayment contractors is greater than 75%, Interior shall calculate for Westlands a per acre foot Restoration Fund payment based on a projection that Westlands would take delivery of the full allocation made to such contractors.",

Reclamation shall identify, as early as practicable upon receipt of an application for a qualifying project, any federal agency that may have jurisdiction over a review, permit, license, approval, or decision required for a qualifying project.

The bill amends the 1960 statute that authorized Interior to construct the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project (CVP), California, to: (1) repeal provisions that include distribution systems and drains as features of such unit, and (2) eliminate requirements for Interior to meet drainage requirements for such unit. Each contractor within the unit that receives water for irrigation shall be responsible for the management of drainage water within its boundaries. The Westlands Water District (the District) shall assume all legal responsibility for the management of drainage water within, and shall not discharge drain water outside of, its boundaries. Interior shall:  convert the District's existing long-term or interim renewal water service contract to a repayment contract,  make allocation decisions in the CVP consistent with federal law and applicable California State Water Resources Control Board requirements, and  enter into a contract with the Navy for the delivery of CVP water to the Lemoore Naval Air Station to meet irrigation needs associated with its air operations.  The bill suspends the District's capital repayment obligation and payments under its water service contracts and the April 1, 1965, repayment contract with the United States until the execution of the repayment contract, after which the District shall: (1) receive a specified credit against future operation and maintenance costs payable to the United States, and (2) be relieved of capital repayment obligations under specified water service contracts. Upon discharge of such capital repayment obligation, the ownership and full cost pricing limitations in federal reclamation law shall not apply to lands in the District.

If the amount allocated is $5 million or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable reclamation law. Upon the execution of the repayment contract, Interior shall transfer to the District title to:  the San Luis Canal System, excluding the main canal that is integrated with the California Aqueduct;  the Mendota Pool diversion facilities operated by the District;  the Pleasant Valley System;  the drainage collection system;  the Tranquillity Field Office;  the Huron field office; and  all real property interests held by the United States in lands associated with such facilities and equipment.

                "summary": "Highlights: The Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015 establishes procedures for the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture to address drought conditions in California by revising regulatory standards for managing conveyances of water to individual, agricultural, municipal, and industrial users from the California-based Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project in coordination with requirements for protecting threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, including fish species of salmonid and smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Suisun Marsh. The bill requires the use of updated data to adjust incidental take levels, water export restrictions, and other conservation measures set forth in a smelt biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on December 15, 2008, and in a salmonid biological opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, in order to increase water exports and maximize water supplies without causing a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of certain species listed as threatened or endangered.  The bill also provides for: (1) a nonnative predator fish removal program in the Stanislaus River, (2) the repeal of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act and the related settlement, (3) expansion of the CVP's authorized service area to include the Kettleman City Community Services District, and (4) the use of expedited procedures to consider project requests from the California governor relating to emergency drought conditions. For areas within and beyond California, the bill revises or establishes requirements for water supply permits, prepayments on water service contracts, water efficiency considerations in dam safety projects, and water rights in land use decisions. Full Summary: Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015 TITLE I--ADJUSTING DELTA SMELT MANAGEMENT BASED ON INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND UPDATED SCIENCE (Sec. 102) Establishes procedures to adjust Delta smelt management measures set forth in the smelt biological opinion for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP) in California issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on December 15, 2008.  Defines: (1) \"Delta\" as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Suisun Marsh, and (2) \"Delta smelt\" as fish species with the scientific name Hypomesus transpacificus.  Requires the USFWS, by October 1, 2016, and at least every five years thereafter, to cooperate with federal, California, and local agencies to use updated scientific and commercial data to modify the calculation of incidental take levels for adult and larval/juvenile Delta smelt in the smelt biological opinion.  Requires the modified incidental take level to be set as the 80% upper prediction interval derived from simulated salvage rates since at least 1993, based on factors including prespawning adult Delta smelt indexes and the flow of the Old and Middle River (OMR) during the adult salvage period, unless the USFWS determines that certain requirements are not appropriate. (Sec. 103) Directs the USFWS to implement and make appropriate amendments to the reasonable and prudent alternative described in the USFWS's smelt biological opinion. Requires Interior to make all significant decisions in writing under the smelt opinion and any successor opinions affecting the CVP or the SWP.  Requires Interior to determine annually: (1) the extent that adult Delta smelt are distributed in relation to certain levels of turbidity or other environmental factors that may influence the salvage rate, and (2) how the CVP and SWP may be operated to minimize salvage while maximizing export pumping rates without causing a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of Delta smelt.  Defines \"negative impact on the long-term survival\" as an appreciable reduction in the likelihood of the survival of a listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species.  Requires Interior, if suspended sediment loads from the Sacramento River appear likely to raise turbidity levels in specified areas during each period from December through March, to conduct daily monitoring to determine how increased trawling can inform real-time CVP and SWP operations. Directs Interior, by January 1, 2016, and at least every five years thereafter, in collaboration with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR), public water agencies, and other interested entities, to implement new targeted sampling and monitoring specifically designed to understand Delta smelt abundance, distribution, and habitats during all life stages. Requires Interior, in implementing provisions of the smelt biological opinion pertaining to reverse flow in the OMR, to maximize CVP and SWP water supplies by managing export pumping rates to a reverse flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second, unless Interior provides documentation concluding that a less negative OMR flow rate is necessary to avoid a negative impact on the long-term survival of Delta smelt. Directs Interior to manage a more negative OMR flow rate if it can be established without an imminent negative impact. Requires the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the USFWS, by December 1, 2015, to execute a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to ensure that the smelt biological opinion is implemented in a manner that maximizes water supply while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Provides a framework under which reinitiation of consultation is unnecessary if any changes that the MOU makes to the biological opinion will not have a significant negative impact on the long-term survival on listed species and would not be a major change to implementation of the biological opinion. Prohibits procedural changes that do not create a significant negative impact on long-term survival from altering application of the take permitted by the incidental take statement in the biological opinion. Directs Interior, for purposes of increasing CVP and SWP water supplies, to revise the method of calculating reverse flow in the OMR for implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the USFWS's smelt biological opinion, the salmonid biological opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on June 4, 2009, and any succeeding opinion. TITLE II--ENSURING SALMONID MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO NEW SCIENCE (Sec. 202) Establishes a process for Reclamation and the Assistant Administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for Fisheries (NOAA Fisheries, also known as the NMFS) to provide for implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternative described in the NMFS's salmonid biological opinion to be adjusted as new scientific and commercial data is developed.  Requires Interior and the Department of Commerce, by December 31, 2016, and at least annually thereafter, to direct Reclamation and the Assistant Administrator to implement certain recommended adjustments to project operations (pertaining to negative OMR flows, timing and triggers for pumping restrictions, and inflow to export ratios) that, in the exercise of the adaptive management provisions of the salmonid biological opinion, will reduce water supply impacts of the salmonid biological opinion on the CVP and the SWP. Requires implementation of adjustments for which: (1) the net effect on listed salmonid species and Delta smelt is equivalent to those of the underlying project operational parameters in the salmonid biological opinion, and (2) the effects of the adjustment can be expected to fall within incidental take authorizations. Directs Reclamation and the Assistant Administrator to evaluate potential species survival improvements likely to result from other measures that, if implemented, would offset adverse effects. Requires survival estimates to be based on: (1) quantitative estimates, or (2) qualitative terms if scientific information is lacking for quantitative estimates.  Requires the Assistant Administrator to compare existing measures to increase through-Delta survival of salmonid through restrictions on export pumping rates to possible alternative management measures to increase salmonid survival through: (1) physical habitat restoration improvements, (2) predation control programs, (3) installation of temporary barriers or management of Cross Channel Gates operations, (4) salvaging near Clifton Court Forebay, or (5) conservation hatchery programs. Directs Reclamation to implement such an alternative measure in order to increase export rates if the Assistant Administrator determines that: (1) the alternative measure is technically feasible and within federal jurisdiction, or (2) California or a local agency has certified that it has the authority and capability to implement the alternative measure. Directs the Assistant Administrator and Reclamation to consider requiring the Assistant Administrator to show that the implementation of certain conservation measures is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on salmonid species before the measures are imposed in any specific instance. Requires the Assistant Administrator, the USFWS, and Reclamation to establish operational criteria to coordinate management of OMR flows under the smelt and salmonid biological opinions to provide additional water supplies. Directs the Assistant Administrator and Reclamation to document the effects of any adaptive management decisions that prioritize the maintenance of one species at the expense of the other. Prohibits the Assistant Administrator and Reclamation from limiting OMR reverse flow to -5,000 cubic feet per second unless current monitoring data indicates that such a limitation is reasonably required to avoid a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.  Directs Commerce, if quantitative estimates of through-Delta survival established to adjust the salmonid biological opinion's pumping restrictions exceed the through-Delta survival established for the opinion's reasonable and prudent alternatives, to evaluate and implement the adjusted management measures as a prerequisite to implementing the alternatives contained in the opinion.  (Sec. 203) Directs Commerce and California's Oakdale and South San Joaquin Irrigation Districts (the districts) to conduct a nonnative predator fish removal program to remove nonnative striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and other nonnative predator fish species from the Stanislaus River. Requires the program to quantify the impact of such removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish. Requires the districts to be responsible for 100% of the cost of such program. Directs Commerce to post on the NMFS's website a summary of the raw data collected under the program each month. Deems the program to be consistent with the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Prohibits striped bass from being treated as anadromous fish for purposes of the CVPIA's application to the program. (Sec. 204) Directs Interior to collaborate with Commerce, the CDFW, and other relevant agencies and interested parties to begin pilot projects to implement the invasive species control program under P.L. 108-361. Requires the projects to: (1) seek to reduce invasive aquatic vegetation, predators, and other competitors that contribute to the decline of native listed pelagic and anadromous species that occupy the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta; and (2) remove, reduce, or control the effects of species, including Asiatic clams, silversides, gobies, Brazilian water weed, water hyacinth, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, striped bass, crappie, bluegill, white and channel catfish, and brown bullheads. Terminates such pilot projects seven years after commencement of their implementation.  TITLE III--OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND DROUGHT RELIEF (Sec. 302) Requires the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce, and the Interior to approve projects and operations to provide the maximum quantity of water supplies practicable to all individuals or districts that receive CVP water under water service or repayments contracts, water rights settlement contracts, exchange contracts, or refuge contracts or agreements, to SWP contractors, and to any other tribe, locality, water agency, or municipality in California to address the emergency drought conditions for the period of time such that in any year that the Sacramento Valley Index is 6.5 or lower, or at California's request, and until two succeeding years after either of those events has been completed where the final index is 7.8 or greater. Directs Commerce and Interior to develop a drought operations plan for such periods.  Provides for: (1) temporary barriers or operable gates to be designed so that formal consultations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) are not necessary; (2) adoption of a 1:1 inflow to export ratio under specified conditions, as measured as a three-day running average at Vernalis between April 1 and May 31, absent a determination in writing that a more restrictive inflow to export ratio is required to avoid a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species under the ESA; and (3) water transfers through the C.W. \"Bill\" Jones Pumping Plant or the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant from April 1 to November 30 if the transfers comply with California law. Provides expedited procedures for consideration of requests by the California governor relating to federal, state, or local projects or operations to provide relief for emergency drought conditions. Requires Interior to convene a final project decision meeting with relevant federal agencies upon the request of the California governor, USDA, or Commerce. Directs the relevant federal agency to issue a final decision on the project within 10 days after the meeting is requested. Allows Interior to also convene such a meeting at its own discretion.  (Sec. 303) Directs Commerce and Interior to ensure that the Delta Cross Channel Gates remain open to the maximum extent practicable using findings from the U.S. Geological Survey on diurnal behavior of juvenile salmonids, timed to maximize the peak flood tide period and provide water supply and water quality benefits for the duration of a California drought emergency declaration and for periods based on Sacramento Valley index levels, or at California's request, consistent with operational and monitoring criteria set forth in the Order Approving a Temporary Urgency Change in License and Permit Terms in Response to Drought Conditions of the California State Water Resources Control Board, effective January 31, 2014, and other associated authorizations. Requires Commerce and Interior, with respect to such gate operations, to: (1) collect data on the impact of such operations on threatened or endangered species, water quality, water supply; (2) collaborate with the CDWR to install a deflection barrier at Georgiana Slough in coordination with diurnal operations to protect migrating salmonids, consistent with knowledge gained from activities in 2014 and 2015; (3) evaluate combined salmonid survival when deciding how to operate the gates to enhance salmonid survival and water supply benefits; and (4) notify Congress by May 15, 2016, regarding the extent to which the gates are able to remain open. Directs Interior to recommend revisions to gate operations, the CVP, and the SWP that are likely to produce water supply benefits without causing a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the listed fish species within the Delta or on water quality.  (Sec. 304) Sets forth requirements concerning Reclamation's responsibility to continue to vary the averaging period of the Delta Export/Inflow ratio pursuant to California State Water Resources Control Board decision D1641 during and in the period after the Sacramento Valley index is 6.5 or lower, or at California's request. (Sec. 305) Allows USDA, Commerce, or Interior to deem alternative arrangements for a project to be in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) during emergency drought conditions if immediate implementation is necessary to address: (1) human health and safety, or (2) a specific and imminent loss of agriculture production upon which an identifiable region depends for 25% or more of its tax revenue used to support public services. Requires consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality to develop such alternative arrangements. (Sec. 306) Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) the implementation of offsite upstream projects in the Delta and upstream of the Sacramento River and San Joaquin basins that offset the effects on threatened or endangered species; (2) management of a more negative reverse flow in the OMR for specific periods; and (3) scientific tools to identify any changes to real-time operations of Reclamation, California, and local water projects that could result in the availability of additional water supplies. (Sec. 307) Requires USDA, Commerce, and Interior to authorize the CVP and the SWP to operate (within ranges permitted by applicable environmental laws) at levels that result in negative OMR flows at -7,500 cubic feet per second daily average for 56 cumulative days after October 1. Authorizes such temporary operational flexibility on days that the CDWR determines the daily average river flow of the Sacramento River is at or above 17,000 cubic feet per second. Allows OMR flow, during the first flush of sediment out of the Delta each water year, to be managed at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet per second for a minimum duration to avoid movement of adult Delta smelt to areas in the southern Delta that would be likely to increase entrainment at CVP and SWP pumping plants.  Requires Reclamation to monitor such operations to ensure that incidental take levels are not exceeded.  Provides a process for Reclamation to use emergency consultation procedures under the ESA to temporarily adjust operating procedures of the relevant biological opinions if operational flexibility actions implemented under this section will exceed 56 days. (Sec. 308) Amends the CVPIA to provide Interior with procedures for expedited transfers of CVP water to assist California urban areas, agricultural water users, and others in meeting their future water needs. (Sec. 309) Exempts from mitigation measure requirements certain operating criteria adjustments, or urgent actions to address water supply shortages for the least amount of time or volume of diversion necessary as determined by Reclamation, during any year that the Sacramento Valley index is 6.5 or lower, or at California's request, and until two succeeding years following either of those events have been completed where the final index is 7.8 or greater. Requires any mitigation measures imposed to be based on quantitative data and required only to the extent that such data demonstrates actual harm to species. (Sec. 310) Directs Reclamation to work with local water and irrigation districts in the Stanislaus River Basin to ascertain the water storage made available by the Draft Plan of Operations in New Melones Reservoir (DRPO) for water conservation programs, conjunctive use projects, water transfers, rescheduled project water, and other projects to maximize water storage and ensure the beneficial use of the water resources in that basin. Requires the source of water for any storage program at New Melones Reservoir to be made available under a valid water right. Directs Reclamation to inform Congress of the amount of storage made available by the DRPO that has been put to use under such program, including proposals from interested parties. (Sec. 311) Requires Interior, in collaboration with the Sacramento Water Forum, to expedite evaluation, completion, and implementation of the Modified Lower American River Flow Management Standard developed by the Water Forum in 2015 to improve water supply reliability for CVP American River water contractors and resource protection in the lower American River during consecutive dry years under current and future demand and climate change conditions. (Sec. 312) Provides for SWP and CVP contractors, if Reclamation or another federal agency initiates or reinitiates consultation with the USFWS or the NMFS with respect to construction or operation of the CVP and SWP, to be accorded all rights and responsibilities extended to applicants in the consultation process. (Sec. 313) Repeals the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act and the related stipulation of settlement in Natural Resources Defense Council v. Rodgers in the Eastern District of California. Deems certain fish and game requirements to be satisfied by the existence of a warm water fishery in the San Joaquin River (below Friant Dam, but upstream of Gravelly Ford) that has an environment suitable for species of fish other than salmon and trout. (Sec. 314) Requires Interior, by December 31, 2015, to develop and implement a program, including rescheduling guidelines for Shasta and Folsom Reservoirs, to allow existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed, as well as refuge service and municipal and industrial water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed and the American River Watershed, to reschedule water provided for under their CVP contracts from one year to the next. Conditions such rescheduling on the program being consistent with existing rescheduling guidelines utilized by Reclamation for rescheduling water for CVP water service contractors that are located south of the Delta. TITLE IV--CALFED STORAGE FEASIBILITY STUDIES (Sec. 401) Establishes deadlines for Interior, through Reclamation, to complete and submit to Congress water storage feasibility studies concerning specified dams and reservoirs under the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act. Requires cooperation with public water agencies that contract with the United States for CVP water and that are expected to participate in the cost pools for the proposed projects. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, if a feasibility report is not submitted on time, to notify each of the relevant congressional committee chairs individually in person on the status of each project once a month until the study is provided to Congress. (Sec. 402) Prohibits the Bakersfield Field Office, Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (RMP), dated December 2014, and the related findings from having any effect on or applicability to Interior's determination of feasibility of, or on any findings or environmental review documents related to: (1) the Temperance Flat Reservoir Project on the Upper San Joaquin River, or (2) Interior's actions regarding Upper San Joaquin River storage in Fresno and Madera Counties. Requires Interior, if it finds the Temperance Flat project to be feasible, to manage land recommended in the RMP for designation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, regardless of whether Interior submits any official recommendation to Congress. (Sec. 404) Allows Reclamation to partner or enter into an agreement on certain water storage projects identified in the Water Supply Reliability and Environmental Improvement Act with local joint powers authorities formed pursuant to state law by irrigation districts and other local water districts and local governments within the applicable hydrologic region.  Authorizes Interior to carry out feasible projects, but prohibits federal funds from being used for construction.  TITLE V--WATER RIGHTS PROTECTIONS (Sec. 501) Directs Interior to confer with the CDFW on potential impacts to any consistency determination for operations of the SWP resulting from the implementation of this Act. Requires additional yield to be made available for delivery to SWP contractors to offset any losses that result if a CDFW consistency determination or take authorization resulting from this Act reduces water supply to the SWP as compared with water supply available under the smelt and the salmonid biological opinions. Directs Interior to notify the CDFW if implementation of the biological opinions under this Act reduces environmental protections for species covered by such opinions.  (Sec. 502) Requires Interior, in the operation of the CVP, to adhere to California laws governing water rights priorities and to honor water rights senior to those held by the United States for operation of the CVP, regardless of the source of priority, including any appropriative water rights initiated prior to December 19, 1914.  (Sec. 503) Requires Interior to ensure that actions taken to comply with environmental laws do not: (1) result in the involuntary reduction of water supply or fiscal impacts to recipients of water from either the SWP or the United States, or (2) cause redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watersheds or the SWP service area.  (Sec. 504) Directs Interior, in the operation of the CVP, to allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed in compliance with specified allocation percentages. Makes Interior's allocations subject to: (1) the priority of individuals or entities with Sacramento River water rights, (2) the U.S. obligation to make a substitute supply of water available to the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, and (3) Interior's obligation to make water available to managed wetlands pursuant to the CVPIA. Declares that Interior's allocation authority shall not be deemed to: (1) modify any provision of a water service contract that addresses municipal and industrial water shortage policies; (2) affect or limit Interior's authority to adopt, modify, or implement municipal and industrial water shortage policies; (3) affect allocations to CVP municipal and industrial contractors; (4) affect the allocation of water to Friant Division contractors; or (5) result in the involuntary reduction in contract water allocations to individuals or entities with contracts to receive water from the Friant Division.  Requires Interior to develop and implement a program to allow existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed to reschedule water, provided for under their water service contracts, from one year to the next.  (Sec. 505) Declares that nothing in this Act preempts or modifies any existing obligation of the United States under federal reclamation law to operate the CVP in conformity with state law, including established water rights priorities. TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS (Sec. 601) Includes the Kettleman City Community Services District within the CVP's authorized service area. Requires Interior to enter a long-term contract with such district for the delivery of up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water for municipal and industrial use, limited to the minimal quantity necessary to meet immediate needs if local supplies or SWP allocations are insufficient.  (Sec. 602) Amends the CVPIA to establish an advisory board to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior regarding expenditures from the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund.  Directs Interior, for each fiscal year, to consult with the advisory board to submit to Congress a plan for the expenditure of all of the funds deposited into the Restoration Fund during the preceding fiscal year. Requires the plan to include an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of each expenditure.  Requires the advisory board to submit: (1) annually to Congress and Interior recommendations regarding priorities and spending levels on projects and programs; and (2) biennially to Congress details regarding progress on certain fish, wildlife, and water management and conservation actions.  (Sec. 603) Sets forth requirements concerning the accounting of CVP water credited to the quantity of CVP yield, excluding CVP water released pursuant to U.S. Department of the Interior Record of Decision, Trinity River Mainstem Fishery Restoration Final Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report, dated December 2000, used to implement an action undertaken for a fishery beneficial purpose that was not imposed by agreements pertaining to the CVP under applicable state or federal law existing on October 30, 1992. Prohibits reclamation policies and allocations from being based upon a premise that CVP contract supplies are supplemental or secondary to any other contractor source of supply. (Sec. 604) Directs Interior to implement an updated plan under the CVPIA to increase the yield of the CVP by the amount dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes. Sets forth a potential amendment that would automatically reduce by 25% the annual quantity of CVP yield that is dedicated and managed for fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration purposes, and for assisting California in protecting waters of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, if: (1) the updated plan has not increased CVP yield by 800,000 acre-feet within five years after enactment of this Act; and (2) by March 15, 2021, and any year thereafter the quantity of CVP water forecasted to be made available to all water service or repayment contractors of the CVP is below 50% of the total quantity of water to be made available under such contracts. (Currently, Interior is authorized to temporarily reduce deliveries of the quantity of water dedicated for such purposes by up to 25% whenever reductions due to hydrologic circumstances are imposed upon CVP agricultural deliveries.) (Sec. 605) Prohibits Interior and Commerce from distinguishing between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned or otherwise artificially propagated strains of a species in making any determination under the ESA that relates to any anadromous or pelagic fish species that resides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta or tributary rivers. (Sec. 606) Directs Interior to negotiate with interested local water and power providers to transfer ownership, control, and operation of the CVP's New Melones Unit to interested local water and power providers in California. Requires Interior to notify Congress every six months regarding the status of such negotiations, past and present formal discussions, and any actions that the United States should take to finalize the transfer agreement.  (Sec. 607) Directs Reclamation, in carrying out the climate change adaptation program, to expand opportunities and expedite assessments, with nonfederal partners, of risks to the water supply of sub-basins and watersheds within major Reclamation river basins. Requires Reclamation to ensure timely decision and expedited implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies developed through the special study process. Makes nonfederal partners responsible for 100% of the special study costs.  (Sec. 608) Prohibits Interior, in operation of the CVP's Trinity River Division, from making releases from Lewiston Dam in excess of the volume for each water-year type (i.e., critically dry, dry, normal, wet, extremely wet) required by Interior's record of decision in the Trinity River Mainstem Fishery Restoration Final Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report dated December 2000.  (Sec. 609) Expands the purposes of the CVPIA to include: (1) ensuring that certain water dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes is replaced and provided to CVP water contractors by December 31, 2018, at the lowest cost reasonably achievable, and (2) facilitating and expediting CVPIA water transfers. (Sec. 610) Redefines \"anadromous fish\" under the CVPIA to: (1) restrict the definition to only native stocks of salmon (including steelhead) and sturgeon that were present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as of October 30, 1992, and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean, and (2) exclude striped bass and American shad. (Sec. 611) Directs Interior to publish an annual report detailing instream flow releases from the CVP and the SWP, their explicit purpose and authority, and all measured environmental benefit of such releases. (Sec. 612) Provides Klamath Project contractors with all the rights and responsibilities extended to applicants under the ESA consultation process if Reclamation initiates or reinitiates consultation with the USFWS or the NMFS with respect to construction or operation of that project. TITLE VII--WATER SUPPLY PERMITTING ACT Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act  (Sec. 703) Establishes Reclamation as the lead agency for purposes of coordinating all reviews, analyses, opinions, statements, permits, licenses, or other approvals or decisions (reviews) required under federal law to construct qualifying projects (defined as new surface water storage projects in the states covered under the Act of June 17, 1902, on lands administered by Interior or USDA, exclusive of any easement, right-of-way, lease, or any private holding).  Directs Reclamation: (1) upon receipt of an application for a qualifying project, to identify any federal agency that may have jurisdiction over a required review; and (2) to notify such agency that it has been designated as a cooperating agency unless the agency notifies Reclamation that the agency has no jurisdiction or authority over the project, has no expertise or information relevant to the project or any associated review, or does not intend to submit comments other than in cooperation with Reclamation.  Allows a state in which a qualifying project is being considered to choose to: (1) participate as a cooperating agency; and (2) make subject to the processes of this title all state agencies that have jurisdiction over the project, that are required to conduct or issue a review, or that are required to make a determination on issuing a permit, license, or approval for the project.  (Sec. 704) Lists as Reclamation's principal responsibilities under this title: (1) to serve as the point of contact for applicants, state agencies, Indian tribes, and others regarding proposed qualifying projects; (2) to coordinate preparation of unified environmental documentation that will serve as the basis for all federal decisions necessary to authorize the use of federal lands for qualifying projects; and (3) to coordinate all federal agency reviews necessary for the development and construction of qualifying projects.  (Sec. 705) Requires each cooperating agency to submit to Reclamation: (1) a time frame for completing the agency's authorizing responsibilities, (2) all environmental review material produced in the course of carrying out activities required under federal law consistent with the project schedule, and (3) all relevant project data. (Sec. 706) Authorizes Interior to accept and expend funds contributed by a nonfederal public entity to expedite the evaluation of a permit of that entity related to a qualifying project. Directs Interior to ensure that all final permit decisions are made available to the public, including on the Internet. TITLE VIII--BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PROJECT STREAMLINING Bureau of Reclamation Project Streamlining Act (Sec. 803) Sets forth provisions governing feasibility studies for water projects initiated by Interior under the Reclamation Act of 1902 (project studies). Requires a project study initiated after enactment of this title to: (1) result in the completion of a final feasibility report within three years; (2) have a maximum federal cost of $3 million; and (3) ensure that personnel from the local project area, region, and Reclamation's headquarters levels concurrently conduct the required review. Sets forth factors for extending such time line for complex projects. Requires Interior to notify Congress of any determinations that a project is complex.  Requires Interior, within 90 days after the initiation of a project study, to: (1) initiate the process for completing reviews, including environmental reviews, required to be completed as part of such study; (2) convene a meeting of federal, tribal, and state agencies required to act; and (3) provide information that will enable required reviews and analyses to be conducted by other agencies in a thorough and timely manner.  Directs Interior to submit to Congress, and make publicly available, information regarding the status of the implementation of this Act and the relevant project studies. Requires: (1) an interim report within 18 months after enactment of this Act, and (2) a final report within four years after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 804) Directs Interior to: (1) expedite the completion of any ongoing project study initiated before the enactment of this title; and (2) proceed directly to preconstruction planning, engineering, and design of a project that it determines is justified.  (Sec. 805) Sets forth requirements applicable to: (1) project studies initiated after enactment of this title for which an environmental impact statement is prepared under NEPA; (2) other project studies initiated before such enactment for which an environmental review process document is prepared under NEPA; and (3) any project study for the development of a nonfederally owned and operated surface water storage project for which Interior determines there is a demonstrable federal interest and that is located in a river basin where other Reclamation water projects are located, that will create additional water supplies that support Reclamation water projects or that will become integrated into the operation of Reclamation water projects.  Requires Interior to:   annually prepare a list of all such studies that do not have adequate funding for study completion;  develop and implement a coordinated environmental review process for the development of such studies;  identify early all federal, state, and local government agencies and Indian tribes that may have jurisdiction and that may be required to act, which the federal lead agency shall invite to become participating or cooperating agencies;  issue guidance regarding the use of programmatic approaches to carry out the environmental review process; and  establish an electronic database and issue reporting requirements to make publicly available the status and progress with respect to compliance with applicable NEPA requirements and other action required for a project study.   Sets forth the authorities and responsibilities of the joint lead agency, which may be a project sponsor, and the federal lead agency in the environmental review process, including: (1) the preparation and use of environmental documents; (2) establishing a plan for coordinating public and agency participation; (3) working with cooperating and participating agencies to identify and resolve issues that could delay process completion or result in the denial of any approval required for the project study; and (4) establishing, upon request, memoranda of agreement with the project sponsor, Indian tribes, and state and local governments to carry out the early coordination activities. Requires a federal lead agency to serve in that capacity for the entirety of all nonfederal projects that will be integrated into a larger system owned, operated, or administered by Reclamation. Directs Interior, upon determining that a project can be expedited by a nonfederal sponsor and that there is a demonstrable federal interest in expediting the project, to advance it as a nonfederal project. Requires a federal jurisdictional agency to complete any required approval or decision for the environmental review process on an expeditious basis.  Provides for a reduction of funds for the office of the head of such an agency that fails to render such a decision by a specified deadline. Requires such funds to be made available (transferred) to the division of the federal jurisdictional agency charged with rendering the decision by not later than one day after the specified deadline and once each week thereafter until a final decision is rendered. Directs the agency, within 10 days after the last date in a fiscal year on which funds of the federal jurisdictional agency may be transferred with respect to an individual decision, to provide written notification to Congress regarding the decision, project study, and transfer amounts.  Allows Reclamation to establish memoranda of agreement with project sponsors, Indian tribes, and state and local governments to carry out early coordination activities and provide technical assistance. Directs Interior to: (1) survey the use by Reclamation of categorical exclusions in projects since 2005 and propose a new categorical exclusion for a category of activities if merited, and (2) establish a program to measure and report on progress made toward improving and expediting the planning and environmental review process.  Requires the Government Accountability Office to submit reports to Congress (within 5 years and within 10 years after enactment of this Act) evaluating the impact of project acceleration measures on project delivery, compliance with environmental laws, and environmental impacts of projects.  Sets forth conditions concerning the categorical exclusion treatment of repairs, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of Reclamation surface water storage projects that are in operation or under construction when damaged by an event or incident that results in a declaration by the President of a major disaster or emergency pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. (Sec. 806) Requires Interior to develop and submit annually a Report to Congress on Future Water Project Development that identifies: (1) the costs and benefits of, the nonfederal interests associated with, and the support for project reports, proposed project studies, and proposed modifications to authorized water projects and project studies that are related to Reclamation's missions and authorities, that require specific congressional authorization, that have not been congressionally authorized, that have not been included in any previous annual report, and that, if authorized, could be carried out by Reclamation; and (2) any project study that was expedited under this title.  Specifies surface water storage, rural water supply, wastewater, and groundwater projects to be included in such studies and reports.  TITLE IX--ACCELERATED REVENUE, REPAYMENT, AND SURFACE WATER STORAGE ENHANCEMENT Accelerated Revenue, Repayment, and Surface Water Storage Enhancement Act (Sec. 902) Directs Interior to convert certain existing water service contracts between the United States and water users' associations to repayment contracts to allow for prepayment of such contracts, upon the request of the contractor. Specifies the manner of conversion and the terms and conditions of prepayment, subject to exceptions for repayment contracts under which the contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment.  Requires a specified percentage of certain receipts generated from prepayment of contracts under this title, beyond amounts necessary to cover the amount of receipts forgone from scheduled payments under current law for the 10-year period following the enactment of this title, to be directed to the Reclamation Surface Water Storage Account. Requires the Secretary to allocate amounts in such Account to fund the construction of surface water storage for:   increased municipal and industrial water supply;  agricultural floodwater, erosion, and sedimentation reduction;  agricultural drainage improvements;  agricultural irrigation;  increased recreation opportunities; and  reduced adverse impacts to fish and wildlife from water storage or diversion projects within watersheds associated with water storage projects funded under this Act.   TITLE X--SAFETY OF DAMS (Sec. 1001) Amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 to authorize Interior, subject to a feasibility study, to develop additional project benefits (including additional conservation storage capacity) through the construction of new or supplementary works when it exercises its authority to modify Reclamation dams and related facilities to preserve their structural safety, provided that: (1) the additional project benefits will promote more efficient management of water and water-related facilities, (2) the feasibility study is authorized under the Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, and (3) the costs are agreed to in writing between Interior and the project proponents and are allocated to the authorized purposes of the structure and repaid consistent with federal reclamation law.  TITLE XI--WATER RIGHTS PROTECTION Water Rights Protection Act (Sec. 1103) Prohibits Interior and USDA from:   conditioning or withholding the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement (permit) on the limitation or encumbrance of any water right or the transfer of any water right to the United States or any other designee or any other impairment of any water right under state law by federal or state action;  requiring any water user (including a federally recognized Indian tribe) to apply for or acquire a water right in the name of the United States under state law as a condition of such a permit;  asserting jurisdiction over groundwater withdrawals or impacts on groundwater resources, unless consistent with state groundwater resource laws, regulations, and policies; or  infringing on the rights and obligations of a state in evaluating, allocating, and adjudicating state waters originating on or under, or flowing from, land owned or managed by the federal government.   (Sec. 1104) Requires Interior and USDA to coordinate with states to ensure that federal actions are consistent with, and impose no greater restrictions or regulatory requirements than, state groundwater laws and programs. Prohibits Interior and USDA from taking actions that adversely affect: (1) water rights granted by a state, (2) a state's authority to adjudicate water rights, (3) groundwater withdrawal conditions and conservation measures established by a state, or (4) the use of groundwater in accordance with state law.

                "summary": "California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014 - Title I: California Emergency Drought Relief - (Sec. 102) Grants the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (Secretaries) emergency authority, subject to existing priorities of individuals and entities, to direct the operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and allow the State Water Project (SWP) operated by the California Department of Water Resources to provide the maximum quantity of water supplies possible to CVP agricultural, municipal and industrial, and refuge service repayment contractors and SWP contractors, by allowing, consistent with applicable laws, any projects or operations to: (1) provide additional water supplies; and (2) address the emergency drought conditions as quickly as possible. Directs the applicable Secretary, in carrying out such emergency authority, to:   authorize and implement actions to ensure that the Delta Cross Channel Gates remain open to the maximum extent practicable timed to maximize peak tide flood periods and to provide water supply and water quality benefits;  implement turbidity control strategies that allow for increased water deliveries for the CVP and the SWP, while avoiding a negative impact on the long-term survival delta smelt due to entrainment at the CVP and SWP pumping plants;  operate pumps within the ranges provided for in the smelt and salmonid biological opinions (issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service) to minimize water supply reductions for the CVP and SWP, manage reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers at negative 5000 cubic feet per second, and show in writing that any determination to manage reverse flow at lower rates is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt;  adopt a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for the increment of increased flow of the San Joaquin River;  issue all necessary permit decisions within 30 days of receiving a completed application by the state of California to place and use temporary barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to improve water quantity and quality for CVP and SWP contractors and other water users;  complete all requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) necessary to make final permit decisions on water transfer requests associated with voluntarily fallowing nonpermanent crops within 30 days after receiving such a request;  allow any North of Delta agricultural water service contractor with unused CVP water to receive such water through April 15 following the contract year in which such water was allocated;  meet the Level 2 and Level 4 water supply needs of units of the National Wildlife Refuge System through the improvement or installation of wells to use groundwater resources and the purchase of water from willing sellers; and implement instream and offsite projects in the Delta and upstream Sacramento River and San Joaquin River basins that offset the effects on endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  Directs federal agency heads to use the expedited procedures of this Act to make final decisions relating to a federal project or operation to provide additional water supplies or to address emergency drought conditions.  Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Interior, upon the request of the state of California, to convene a final project decision meeting with the heads of relevant federal agencies to decide whether to approve a project to provide emergency water supplies, and (2) the agency heads to issue a final decision on a project not later than 10 days after a meeting is requested.  (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretaries to: (1) permit the CVP and SWP, combined, to operate at levels that result in negative Old and Middle River flows at -7500 cubic feet per second for a cumulative period of 28 days after October 1 of each water year during periods in which the daily average river flow of the Sacramento River is at or above 17,000 cubic feet per second (temporary operational flexibility); and (2) continue to impose requirements under the smelt and salmonid biological opinions necessary to avoid additional negative impacts on the long-term survival of a listed fish species beyond the range of those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretaries to provide a progress report on the implementation of emergency drought relief projects under this title to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary of the Interior, one year after the enactment of this Act, to provide a progress report on the status of certain feasibility studies, including timelines for study completions and environmental documents.  Title II: Protection of Third-Party Water Rights - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to confer with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife on potential impacts to any consistency determination for operations of the SWP resulting from the implementation of this Act. (Sec. 202) Requires the Secretary, in the operation of the CVP, to adhere to California laws governing water rights priorities and honor water rights senior to those held by the United States for operation of the CVP, regardless of the source of priority, including any appropriative water rights initiated prior to December 19, 1914. (Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary to ensure that actions taken to comply with environmental laws do not: (1) result in the involuntary reduction of water supply or fiscal impacts to recipients of water from either the SWP or the United States, or (2) cause redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watersheds or the SWP service area.  (Sec. 204) Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in the operation of the CVP, to allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed in compliance with specified allocation percentages. Makes the Secretary's allocations subject to: (1) the priority of individuals or entities with Sacramento River water rights, (2) the U.S. obligation to make a substitute supply of water available to the Sans Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, and (3) the Secretary's obligation to make water available to managed wetlands pursuant to the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. Declares that the Secretary's allocation authority shall not be deemed to: (1) modify any provision of a water service contract that addresses municipal and industrial water shortage policies; (2) affect or limit the authority of the Secretary to adopt, modify, or implement municipal and industrial water shortage policies; (3) affect allocations to CVP municipal and industrial contractors; (4) affect the allocation of water to Friant Division contractors; or (5) result in the involuntary reduction in contract water allocations to individuals or entities with contracts to receive water from the Friant Division.  Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a program to allow existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed to reschedule water, provided for under their water service contracts, from one year to the next.  Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 301) Declares that nothing in this Act preempts or modifies any existing obligation of the United States under federal reclamation law to operate the CVP in conformity with state law, including established water rights priorities. (Sec. 302) Terminates this Act on the later of September 30, 2016, or the date on which the governor of California suspends the state of drought emergency declaration. ",

                "summary": "Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act - Title I: Central Valley Project Water Reliability - (Sec. 101) Amends the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) to include among the Act's purposes to: (1) ensure that water dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes is replaced and provided to Central Valley Project (CVP) water contractors by December 31, 2018, at the lowest cost reasonably achievable, and (2) facilitate and expedite water transfers in accordance with that Act. (Sec. 102) Redefines \"anadromous fish\" to: (1) include those native stocks of salmon (including steelhead) and sturgeon that, as of October 30, 1992, were present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean; and (2) exclude non-native striped bass and American shad. Defines \"reasonable flows\" as water flows capable of being maintained taking into account competing consumptive uses of water and economic, environmental, and social factors. (Sec. 103) Eliminates existing limitations on the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to enter into any new contracts for water supply from the CVP. Directs the Secretary to renew any existing long-term repayment or water service contract, upon request of the contractor, that provides for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 40 years (the current contractual term is 25 years). Requires new or renewed contracts to include a provision that requires the Secretary to charge only for water actually delivered. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to take all necessary actions to facilitate and expedite CVP water transfers in accordance with CVPIA or any other provision of federal reclamation law and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Requires: (1) the contracting district from which the water is coming, the agency, or the Secretary to determine if a written water transfer proposal is complete within 45 days after the date of submission of such proposal; and (2) the district, agency, or Secretary to state with specificity what must be added or revised if such proposal is determined to be incomplete. Prohibits the Secretary from imposing mitigation or other requirements on a proposed transfer of water. Declares that: (1) the authority to make transfers or exchanges of, or banking or recharge arrangements using, CVP water that could have been conducted before October 30, 1992, is valid and such transfers, exchanges, or arrangements shall not be subject to, limited, or conditioned by this title; and (2) this title shall not supersede or revoke the authority to transfer, exchange, bank, or recharge CVP water that existed prior to such date. Requires: (1) measurement (currently, metering) of water use; and (2) the contracting district or agency, excluding districts serving multiple agencies with separate governing boards, to ensure that all contractor-owned water delivery systems within its boundaries measure surface water at the district or agency's facilities up to the point the surface water is commingled with other water supplies. Repeals provisions regarding water pricing reform. Requires all revenues received by the Secretary that exceed the cost-of-service to be covered to the CVP Restoration Fund. (Sec. 105) Grants the Secretary discretion to modify CVP operations to provide reasonable water flows of suitable quality, quantity, and timing to protect all life stages of anadromous fish. Provides that instream flow needs for CVP controlled streams and rivers shall be determined by the Secretary based on recommendations of the National Marine Fisheries Service (as well as recommendations of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service), after consultation with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (currently, consultation is required with the California Department of Fish and Game). Provides that all CVP water used for purposes specified in CVPIA shall be credited to the quantity of CVP yield dedicated and managed under that Act by determining how the dedication and management of such water would affect the delivery capability of the CVP during the 1928 to 1934 drought period after fishery, water quality, and other flow and operational requirements imposed by terms and conditions existing in agreements pertaining to CVP under applicable law existing on October 30, 1992, have been met. Requires CVP water to be reused to fulfill the secretary's remaining contractual obligations to provide CVP water for agricultural or municipal and industrial purposes. States that: (1) if, by March 15th of any year, the quantity of CVP water forecasted to be made available to water service or repayment contractors in the Delta Division of CVP is below 75% of the total quantity made available under such contracts, the quantity of CVP yield dedicated and managed for that year shall be reduced by 25%; and (2) by pursuing activities described in this section, the Secretary shall be deemed to have met the mitigation, protection, restoration, and enhancement purposes of this title. (Sec. 106) Repeals a requirement that not less than 67% of all funds made available to the Restoration Fund under CVPIA be authorized to be appropriated to carry out habitat restoration, improvement, and acquisition provisions of that Act. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring: (1) a donation or other payment to the Fund or environmental restoration or mitigation fees not otherwise provided by law as a condition to providing for storage or conveyance of non-CVP water or for the delivery of water pursuant to the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, or (2) a donation or other payment to the Fund for any water that is delivered with the sole intent of groundwater recharge. Requires annual payments to the Fund to be allocated so as not to exceed $4 per megawatt-hour for CVP power sold to power contractors (October 2015 price levels) after October 1, 2015. Requires the Secretary to: (1) reduce certain sums and payment ceilings for the Fund upon the completion of certain fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions by no later than December 31, 2020; and (2) submit a plan for Fund expenditures, including a cost effectiveness analysis of each expenditure. Establishes a Restoration Fund Advisory Board to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding priorities and spending levels on projects and programs under CVPIA. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary to: (1) use the authority granted in the CVPIA in connection with requests to exchange, impound, store, carry, or deliver nonproject water using CVP facilities for any beneficial purpose; and (2) develop rates not to exceed the amount required to recover the reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in connection with a beneficial purpose. Requires such rates to be charged to a party using CVP facilities for such purpose and to exclude any donation or other payment to the Fund. Requires the filing and adequacy of the Secretary's annual reports to Congress to be personally certified to specified committees by the Regional Director of the Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation. Directs the Secretary, in order to minimize adverse effects on existing CVP water contractors resulting from water dedicated to fish and wildlife and to assist the state of California in meeting its future water needs, to submit to Congress on a priority basis by September 30, 2015, a least-cost plan to increase, as soon as possible but not later than September 30, 2018 (except for the construction of new facilities, which shall not be limited by that deadline), the CVP water by the amount dedicated and managed for fish and wildlife purposes and otherwise required to meet CVP purposes, including satisfying contractual obligations. Requires the plan to include: (1) recommendations on appropriate cost-sharing arrangements and authorizing legislation or other measures needed to implement the intent, purposes, and provisions of this section; and (2) a description of how the Secretary intends to use specified options. Directs the Secretary to implement the plan commencing on October 1, 2015, and to coordinate with the state of California in implementing measures for the long-term resolution of problems in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Provides that if the plan fails to increase the annual delivery capability of CVP by 800,000 acre-feet by September 30, 2018, implementation of any non-mandatory action dedicating the 800,000 acre-feet for fish, wildlife, and habitat purposes shall be suspended until the plan achieves an increase in the annual delivery capability of CVP by such amount. Authorizes the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation to partner or enter into an agreement with local joint powers authorities formed pursuant to state law by irrigation districts and other local water districts and local governments within the applicable hydrologic region to advance water storage projects identified in the Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act. (Sec. 108) Requires the CVP and the California State Water Project (SWP) to be operated pursuant to the water quality standards and operational constraints described in the Principles for Agreement of the Bay-Delta Standards Between the state of California and the Federal Government, dated December 15, 1994 (Bay-Delta Accord of 1994), without regard to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) or any other law pertaining to the operation of the CVP and the SWP. Prohibits any federal department or the state of California from imposing on any water right obtained under state law, including a pre-1914 appropriative right, any condition that restricts the exercise of that water right in order to protect any species that is affected by CVP or SWP operations. Requires implementation of the Bay-Delta Accord to be in strict compliance with the water rights priority system and statutory protections for areas of origin. Prohibits any cost associated with implementation from being imposed on any CVP contractor or other person or entity unless incurred on a voluntary basis. Preempts California law regarding any restriction on the quantity or size of non-native fish that preys upon one or more native fish species that occupy the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries or the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers Delta that may be taken or harvested. (Sec. 109) Prohibits the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce from distinguishing between natural-spawned and hatchery-spawned or otherwise artificially propagated strains of a species in making any determination under ESA that relates to any anadromous fish species that are present in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers or their tributaries and that ascend those rivers and their tributaries to reproduce after maturing in the San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean. (Sec. 110) Adds the Kettleman City Community Services District as an authorized service area of the CVP. Directs the Secretary to enter into a long-term contract for the delivery of up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water for municipal and industrial use. Authorizes the Secretary to temporarily reduce deliveries of the quantity of CVP water up to 25% of the total contractual amount whenever reductions due to hydrologic circumstances are imposed upon agricultural deliveries of CVP water. Makes any additional infrastructure or related costs the responsibility of the non-federal entity. (Sec. 111) Declares that: (1) filing a Notice of Determination or a Notice of Exemption for any project, including the issuance of a permit under state law, related to any project of the CVP or the delivery of water from it in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act shall be deemed to meet the requirements of NEPA for that project or permit; and (2) the Bureau of Reclamation shall not be required to cease or modify any major federal action or other activity related to any CVP project or water delivery from it, pending completion of judicial review of any determination under NEPA. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary to offer to the Oakdale Irrigation District, the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, and the Calaveras County Water District a contract enabling such districts to collectively impound and store a portion of their Stanislaus River water rights in the New Melones Reservoir in accordance with applicable terms of the Warren Act.  (Sec. 114) Directs the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, in consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, to jointly develop and conduct a seven-year scientifically-based pilot non-native predator fish removal program to remove non-native striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and other non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River in California. Makes the Oakdale Irrigation District and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District responsible for the funding of such pilot program. Requires the Commissioner to post on the website of the Bureau of Reclamation a tabular summary of the raw data collected by the pilot program. (Sec. 115) Directs the Secretary, if the San Luis Reservoir does not fill by the last day of February, to permit any entity with an agricultural water service or repayment contract for the delivery of water from the Delta Division or the San Luis Unit to reschedule into the immediately following contract year (i.e., March 1 through the last day of February) any unused CVP water previously allocated for irrigation purposes.  Title II: San Joaquin River Restoration - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease any action to implement the Stipulation of Settlement (Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California) (the Settlement).  (Sec. 202) Modifies the purpose of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act to be restoration of the San Joaquin River (currently, to authorize implementation of the Settlement). (Sec. 204) Amends such Act to eliminate references to the Settlement and to direct the Secretary, beginning on March 1, 2015, to modify Friant Dam operations to release restoration flows (defined as additional water released or bypassed from Friant Dam to ensure that the target flow entering Mendota Pool does not fall below 50 cubic feet per second) in every year except a critical water year (defined as when the total unimpaired runoff at Friant Dam is less than 400,000 acre-feet) in a manner that improves the fishery in the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and Gravelly Ford. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement, in cooperation with the state of California, a reasonable plan to fully recirculate, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer all such restoration flows. Requires such plan to address any impact on ground water resources within the service area of the Friant Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit of the CVP. Permits mitigation to include ground water banking and recharge projects. Directs the Secretary, prior to October 1, 2015, to: (1) identify the impacts associated with the release of such restoration flows; (2) identify measures necessary to mitigate impacts on adjacent and downstream water users, landowners, and agencies as a result of such restoration flows; and (3) implement all such mitigation measures identified before such restoration flows are commenced. Directs the Secretary to promulgate a rule establishing a claims process to address current and future claims, including ground water seepage, flooding, or levee instability damages caused by such restoration flows. Provides that all actions taken under this title shall be subordinate to the Secretary's use of CVP facilities to make CVP water available to its contractors, other than water released from the Friant Dam pursuant to this title. Preempts and supersedes any state law, regulation, or requirement that imposes more restrictive requirements or regulations on the activities authorized under this title. Directs the Secretary to phase in each project to implement this title in the following order: (1) identify project purpose and need, (2) identify mitigation measures, (3) conduct environmental review, and (4) complete implementation of the project and required mitigation measures. (Sec. 205) Deletes language that directs implementation of the Settlement and that authorizes the use of eminent domain to implement the Settlement. (Sec. 207) Declares that implementation of this title satisfies federal obligations under the California Fish and Game Code. (Sec. 208) Provides that nothing shall confer a private right of action or claim for relief to enforce provisions under section 204 of this Act, except for contractors within the Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit. (Sec. 211) Repeals provisions requiring the reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon into the San Joaquin River. (Sec. 213) Eliminates certain additional funding for improvements and facilities in the Friant Division, CVP, California. Title III: Repayment Contracts and Acceleration of Repayment of Construction Costs - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, upon request of the contractor, to convert all existing long-term CVP contracts to contracts that require a contractor to pay the remaining balance of construction at a Treasury rate discount. Provides that: (1) in return, pricing and acreage limitations of federal reclamation law shall no longer apply to the contractors; and (2) any capital costs incurred after the date of conversion will be repaid either within five years, if the amount is less than $5 million, or as provided by applicable reclamation law, if the amount is $5 million or greater. Provides that this title shall not alter the repayment obligation of any other long-term water service or repayment contractor receiving water from CVP or shift any costs that would otherwise have been properly assignable to any contractors. Title IV: Bay-Delta Watershed Water Rights Preservation and Protection - (Sec. 401) Directs the Secretary of the Interior (notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, federal reclamation law, or ESA), in the operation of CVP, to: (1) strictly adhere to state water rights law governing water rights priorities by honoring water rights senior to those belonging to CVP, regardless of the source of priority; and (2) strictly adhere to and honor water rights and other priorities that are obtained or that exist under the California Water Code. Requires any action taken by the Secretary or the Secretary of Commerce to protect any species listed under ESA that affects the diversion of water or that involves the release of water from any CVP water storage facility to be applied in a manner that is consistent with water right priorities established by state law. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce, in implementing ESA in the Bay-Delta and on the Sacramento River, to apply any limitations on the operation of CVP or to formulate any reasonable prudent alternative associated with CVP's operation in a manner that strictly adheres to and applies water rights priorities for project water and base supply provided for in the Sacramento River settlement contracts. (Sec. 403) Directs the Secretary, subject to the absolute priority of Sacramento River settlement contractors, to allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed in the following order: (1) not less than 100% of their contract quantities in a wet, above normal, or below normal year; (2) not less than 75% in a dry year; and (3) not less than 50% in a critically dry year. (Sec. 404) Directs the Secretary to ensure that there are no redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watershed or to the SWP arising from the Secretary's operation of CVP to meet legal obligations imposed by or through any state or federal agency. Title V: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 501) Declares that: (1) coordinated operations between CVP and SWP, previously requested and consented to by the state of California and the federal government, require assertion of federal supremacy to protect existing water rights throughout the system; (2) these circumstances are unique to California; and (3) nothing in this Act shall serve as precedent in any other state.  (Sec. 502) Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect the Proclamation of State of Emergency and the associated executive order issued on January 17, 2014, by the Governor of California or the authorities granted thereby. (Sec. 503) Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to: (1) decrease the length of a segment of the Lower Merced River in California designated as a wild and scenic river; and (2) revise provisions concerning the water surface level of Lake McClure in Mariposa County, California.  Restores the boundary of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Project No. 2179 (New Exchequer Project) as it existed on February 15, 2013.  (Sec. 504) Deems the Proclamation of State of Emergency and associated executive order issued by the Governor of California on January 17, 2014, as a request under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to determine that a fishery resource disaster exists for fisheries that originate in California.
