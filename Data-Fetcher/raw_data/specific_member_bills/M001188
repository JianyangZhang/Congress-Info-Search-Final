The bill bars employers from compelling a pregnant intern to take a leave of absence, unless the intern is prevented by such pregnancy from performing internship activities in a reasonable manner.

The age discrimination prohibitions of this bill apply only to individuals who are at least 40 years of age.  The bill authorizes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Library of Congress, the Board of Directors of Congress's Office of Compliance, the Department of Justice, the President, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and U.S. courts to enforce this bill under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, and other laws granting rights and protections to certain applicants and employees.",

The bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to require the Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board to establish written guidelines for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program to ensure that funds provided under the program to private nonprofit organizations and local governments may be used to provide menstrual hygiene products. Each state that receives a grant under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program must annually certify to the Department of Justice (DOJ) that all female inmates and detainees in that state have access to menstrual hygiene products on demand and at no cost to the inmates and detainees. If a state does not submit the required certification, DOJ must reduce the state's grant funding under the program by 20% and reallocate the funding to states that submitted certifications.  This bill also amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to require the Department of Labor to issue a rule requiring private employers with not less than 100 employees to provide free menstrual hygiene products for their employees.
