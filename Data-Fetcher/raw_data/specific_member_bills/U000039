The Bureau, in cooperation with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, may provide funding and technical assistance for the installation of metering and measurement devices and the construction of check structures to: (1) ensure the conservation and efficient use of water by reducing actual consumptive use or by not increasing the use of water, and (2) improve the measurement and allocation of water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall continue, for five years after enactment of this bill, the temporary deviation in the operation of Cochiti Lake and Jemez Canyon Dam that was initiated in 2009 and terminated in 2013, to evaluate the benefits of the deviation. The bill authorizes financial assistance to be made available for eligible water projects to help western states and tribal governments address drought-related impacts to water supplies or any other immediate water-related crisis or conflict. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 is amended to: (1) authorize the use of water management improvement grants to assist applicants in planning for or addressing the impacts of drought, and (2) authorize the Bureau to waive any cost-share requirements. The Department of Agriculture may allocate certain financial assistance made available under the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish special conservation initiatives at the local, state, or regional level to assist producers in implementing eligible activities on agricultural land in the western states for: (1) mitigating the effects of drought; (2) improving water quality and quantity; (3) restoring, enhancing, and preserving fish and wildlife habitat; and (4) promoting innovative and collaborative conservation tools and approaches.",

Any communication related to outstanding credit must be directed to the child's parent or guardian. A child may be required to deliver a letter regarding outstanding credit that is addressed to a parent or guardian if the letter is not distributed to the child in a manner that stigmatizes the child.
