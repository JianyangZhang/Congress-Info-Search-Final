Individuals residing in the areas or counties may use the premium assistance tax credit through 2019 to enroll in a plan outside of an exchange if the plan is: (1) authorized by the state in which the taxpayer resides to be offered in the individual market, or (2) is a not-for-profit membership organization that is organized and authorized under state law to accept member contributions to fund health care benefits for members and their families.  The bill prohibits advance payments of the credit from being made with respect to the off-exchange plans and specifies reporting requirements for the plans. Through 2019, the bill also exempts the individuals residing in the counties or areas from the requirement to maintain minimum essential health coverage (commonly referred to as the individual mandate).

Before tendering a shipment, but not more than 35 days before the pickup of a shipment by the hired motor carrier, an entity shall verify that the carrier:   is registered with and authorized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to operate as a motor carrier or household goods motor carrier,   has the minimum insurance coverage required by federal law, and   does not have an unsatisfactory safety fitness rating issued by the FMCSA and has not otherwise been ordered to discontinue operations.  Only evidence of an entity's compliance with this bill may be admitted as evidence in a civil action for damages resulting from a case or proceeding in which it is alleged that such entity's selection or retention of a motor carrier was negligent. No other motor carrier data created or maintained by the FMCSA, including safety measurement system data or analysis of such data, may be admitted in such case or proceeding.",
