The bill modifies the EITC for individuals with no qualifying children by:    increasing the credit and phaseout percentages,   increasing the earned income and phaseout amounts,   reducing the minimum age to claim the credit, and   modifying the formula for inflation adjustments.  For a qualifying child to be taken into account for the EITC, a tax return must include a certification of the child's residency.  The bill prohibits the refundable portion of the child tax credit (commonly referred to as the additional child tax credit) from being claimed for a qualifying child unless the tax return includes a valid Social Security number for the child. The bill increases from two to five years the disallowance period for taxpayers who improperly claim the EITC due to reckless or intentional disregard of rules and regulations. ",

The sponsor of a conditionally approved cellular therapy must apply for approval of the product as a biological product within five years. Unless the FDA has decided not to approve the product, the product may be marketed during this five-year period and the FDA may permit continued marketing while the application is being reviewed. An individual administering a conditionally approved cellular therapy must inform the recipient regarding conditional approval. The premarket report for a medical device used for cellular therapy must include specified information regarding the preparation or delivery of the cellular therapy. The approval of a medical device that is a cellular therapy must be based on laboratory performance testing and not clinical trials. A medical device used for cellular therapy is subject to medical device classification. The FDA must not limit the use of these devices to only specific cell types unless unique to the use of the device. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction for premarket review of combination products that act primarily through cellular components. The Department of Health and Human Services must work with stakeholders to promote the development of standards for regenerative medicine products.",
