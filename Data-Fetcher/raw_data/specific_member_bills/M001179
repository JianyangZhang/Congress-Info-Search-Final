The trust agreement governing such an assets transfer must meet specified requirements. The court may order such an assets transfer only if it determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the transfer is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, (2) other specified requirements are met. The bill imposes a temporary stay on actions to terminate or modify contracts with institutions that enter the Subchapter V bankruptcy process. Members of the institution's board of directors shall have no liability to shareholders or creditors for a good faith filing of a petition to commence a Subchapter V bankruptcy case. The bill specifies timelines with respect to the commencement of a case and the transfer of assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, among other federal regulatory agencies, shall have standing in a Subchapter V bankruptcy case. Under specified conditions, a Subchapter V bankruptcy case may be converted into a case in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (also known as \"liquidation\" bankruptcy).
