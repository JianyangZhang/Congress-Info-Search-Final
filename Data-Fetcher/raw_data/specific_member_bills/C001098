                "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate passed version is repeated here.) National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for FY2017 for:    exploration;   space operations;   science;   aeronautics;   space technology;   education;   safety, security, and mission services;   construction and environmental compliance and restoration; and   the NASA Inspector General.  TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS (Sec. 201) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should be a multi-mission space agency and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.  TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT (Sec. 301) The bill states that the primary objectives of the International Space Station (ISS) program shall be to:  achieve the long-term goal and objectives for human space flight and exploration as specified in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, and  pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the nation.    The bill restates that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.  In furthering such policy, NASA shall:  pursue international, commercial, and intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply, maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize U.S. operations costs relating to the ISS; utilize the ISS for the development of capabilities and technologies needed for the future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and  utilize the ISS for Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.   (Sec. 302) It is the sense of Congress that:   NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since 2012, and  the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be continued so as to leverage state and private investments to achieve such program's goals.   Congress reaffirms:  its commitment to the use of a commercially developed, private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew missions; and  the requirement that NASA shall make use of U.S. commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services.   The federal government may not acquire human space flight transportation services from a foreign entity unless:  there is no U.S. government-operated human space flight capability available, there is no U.S. commercial provider available, and  it is a qualified foreign entity.   The bill declares that nothing in this section shall prevent NASA from negotiating or entering into human space flight transportation arrangements with foreign entities to ensure safety of flight and continued ISS operations.  The bill states that the objective of the Commercial Crew Program shall be to assist in the development and certification of commercially provided transportation that can: (1) carry U.S. government astronauts safely, reliably, and affordably to and from the ISS; (2) serve as a crew rescue vehicle; and (3) accomplish those goals as soon as practicable. Such objective shall be the primary consideration in the acquisition strategy for such program.  NASA shall protect the safety of government astronauts by ensuring that each commercially provided transportation system under the Commercial Crew Program meets all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.  Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, NASA shall ensure that safety and the minimization of the probability of loss of crew are the critical priorities of such program.  NASA shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed the Commercial Resupply Services Program.  The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, and to minimize the life cycle cost to NASA, NASA shall procure services for federal government access to and return from the ISS by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.  NASA shall, in a manner that does not add costs or schedule delays to the Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services programs, ensure that all providers of such programs furnish evidence-based support for their costs and schedules. NASA shall submit to Congress a report:  identifying the lessons learned to date from previous and existing Commercial Resupply Services contracts, indicating whether changes are needed as to the manner in which NASA procures and manages similar services prior to the issuance of future Commercial Resupply Services procurement opportunities, and  identifying any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contracts that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS or to other future procurements.  (Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA could be one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit non-governmental human space flight enterprise. NASA shall submit biennial reports until 2023 which include:   a description of the progress NASA is making in achieving its deep space human exploration objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future mission requirements, space exploration objectives, and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit;  identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; the cost estimates for extending operations of the ISS to 2024, 2028, and 2030; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; and the impact on deep space exploration capabilities, including a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, if the preferred service life of the ISS is extended beyond 2024 and NASA maintains a flat budget profile.   The bill defines \"cis-lunar space\" as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.

(Sec. 837) The bill states it is U.S. policy that NASA maintain reliable and efficient facilities and infrastructure and that decisions on whether to dispose of, maintain, or modernize existing facilities or infrastructure be made in the context of meeting NASA's future needs.  NASA shall develop a facilities and infrastructure plan to position it to have the facilities and infrastructure (including laboratories, tools, and approaches) necessary to meet NASA and other federal agencies' future laboratory needs.  Such plan shall identify:  current NASA and other federal agencies' laboratory needs; future NASA research and development and testing needs; a strategy for identifying facilities and infrastructure that are candidates for disposal, consistent with the national strategic direction set forth in the National Space Policy, National Aeronautics Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Infrastructure Plan, specified NASA authorization acts, and the Human Exploration Roadmap; a strategy for the maintenance, repair, upgrading, and modernization of NASA facilities and infrastructure;  criteria for prioritizing deferred maintenance tasks; an assessment of modifications needed to maximize usage of facilities that offer unique and highly specialized benefits to the aerospace industry and the American public; and  implementation steps, including a timeline, milestones, and an estimate of resources required for carrying out the plan.    NASA must establish a policy that guides its use of existing authorities to out-grant, lease, excess to the General Services Administration, sell, decommission, demolish, or otherwise transfer property, facilities, or infrastructure. (Sec. 838) The bill modifies requirements for the establishment of independent, nonpartisan commissions to investigate human space flight accidents and/or deaths by requiring the President to establish such a commission to investigate any accident that results in the loss of any orbital or suborbital space vehicle carrying humans that is:  owned by the federal government; or  being used pursuant to a contract or Space Act Agreement with the federal government to carry a government astronaut (as defined in federal law) or a researcher funded by the federal government.  (Sec. 839) NASA shall report to Congress on the status of its efforts to coordinate with foreign countries within the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee to mitigate the effects and growth of orbital debris. The OSTP shall report to Congress on the status of the orbital debris mitigation strategy.  (Sec. 840) NASA shall:    in collaboration with other relevant federal agencies, solicit and review concepts and options for the removal of orbital debris from low-Earth orbit; and   submit a report on such solicitation and review, including recommendations on the best options for decreasing the risks associated with orbital debris.   (Sec. 841) NASA shall seek to maximize the value of contributions provided by other parties under funded Space Act Agreements in order to advance NASA's mission. NASA shall issue each agreement:  on a nonexclusive basis, in a manner that ensures that all non-government parties have equal access to NASA resources, and  by exercising reasonable care not to reveal unique or proprietary information.   If an exclusive arrangement is necessary, NASA shall issue an agreement: (1) using a competitive selection process, and (2) pursuant to public announcements. NASA shall publicly disclose and make available on its website each agreement within 60 days after that agreement is signed. NASA shall submit annual reports on use of its authority to enter into such agreements and on all anticipated reimbursable, non-reimbursable, and funded agreements for the upcoming fiscal year. Each report shall include for a covered agreement a summary of:   the technology areas in which research projects were conducted,  how the use of the agreement has contributed to a broadening of the technology and industrial base available for meeting NASA's needs and has fostered new relationships and practices that support the United States, and  the value received by the federal government during the fiscal year under that agreement.
