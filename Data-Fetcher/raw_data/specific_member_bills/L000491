TITLE II--SUBSEASONAL AND SEASONAL FORECASTING INNOVATION (Sec.201)The NWSmust collect and utilize information to make reliable and timely foundational forecasts of subseasonal and seasonal temperature and precipitation. Subseasonal forecasting is forecasting weather between two weeks and three months and seasonal forecasting is between three months and two years. TITLE III--WEATHER SATELLITE AND DATA INNOVATION (Sec.301)NOAA must complete and operationalize the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (a weather satellite program which develops observational techniques using global navigation systems). (Sec.302)The bill permits the purchase of weather data by the federal government through contracts with commercial providers and the placement of weather satellite instruments on co-hosted government or private payloads. (Sec.303)NOAA must avoid unnecessary duplication between public and private sources of data and the corresponding expenditure of funds and employment of personnel. TITLE IV--FEDERAL WEATHER COORDINATION (Sec.401)The NOAA Science Advisory Board must continue to maintain the Environmental Information Services Working Group. Membership requirements and reporting requirements for the group are established.  (Sec.402)The Office of Science and Technology Policy must establish an Inter-agency Committee for Advancing Weather Services to improve coordination of relevant weather research and forecast innovation activities.  (Sec.403)The OAR and the NWS may establish a program to detail their personnel to each other with the goal of enhancing forecasting innovation through regular, direct interaction between OAR scientists and NWS operational staff. (Sec.404)The NWS may establish a program to host postdoctoral fellows and academic researchers at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  (Sec.405)The NWS must designate warning coordination meteorologists at each of its weather forecast offices.

The Board provides scientific advice to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This bill requires the Board to independently provide that advice. Among the revisions to requirements concerning the Board's membership are the following:  a requirement to balance scientific and technical points of view; a set minimum level of representation from state, local, or tribal governments; allowance of affiliation with or representation of entities that may have a potential interest in the Board's advisory activities; conflict of interest restrictions; restrictions on participation in advisory activities involving review of a member's work;  restrictions on appointment of registered lobbyists; and prohibitions on member receipt of current EPA grants or contracts.  The EPA must make public a list of nominees to the Board and accept public comments on the nominees. Reports filed upon the provisional nomination of a member disclosing financial relationships and interests must also be made public. The EPA must provide draft risk or hazard assessments in its regulatory proposals and documents to the Board. The Board's advice and comments must be included in the record regarding any such proposal and published in the Federal Register. The Board's member committees and investigative panels must operate in accordance with the membership, participation, and policy requirements contained in this Act, including new requirements for public participation in advisory activities of the Board. The member committees and investigative panels do not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Board and may not report directly to the EPA. The bill imposes additional public participation requirements:  The EPA and the Board must make public all reports and relevant scientific information at the same time they are received by the Board.  The Board must hold public information-gathering sessions to discuss the state of the science related to a major advisory activity.  Prior to convening a member committee or investigative panel, the EPA must accept and address public comments on questions asked of the Board.  The Board, member committees, and investigative panels may not accept a question that unduly narrows the scope of an advisory activity.    The Board must strive to avoid making policy determinations or recommendations, communicate uncertainties, encourage dissenting members to make their views known, conduct periodic reviews to ensure that its activities address the most important scientific issues affecting the EPA, and respond to Congress fully and in a timely manner.

(Sec. 106) Authorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to require that property of the bankruptcy estate, including trading or operating accounts and commodities held in inventory, of a commodity broker who is a Chapter 7 debtor in bankruptcy be included in customer property, subject to any otherwise unavoidable security interest, or otherwise unavoidable contractual offset or netting rights of creditors in respect of such property, but only to the extent that such property is insufficient to satisfy the net equity claims of the broker's public customers.  (Sec. 107) Directs the CFTC to examine the effect of high-frequency trading upon markets under its jurisdiction, particularly whether such trading increases market volatility, including short term market swings. Title II: Commodity Futures Trading Commission Reforms - Commodity Futures Trading Commission Reform Act - (Sec. 203) Extends authority for CFTC operations. Amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to revise the requirement that the CFTC, before promulgating a regulation or issuing an order, consider the costs and benefits of the action. Requires the CFTC, through the Office of the Chief Economist (established by this Act), to: (1) assess and publish the costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of the proposed regulation; and (2) require the proposed regulation or order to state its statutory justification. Requires a court to affirm a CFTC assessment of costs and benefits, unless it finds the assessment to be an abuse of discretion. (Sec. 204) States that the heads of CFTC units (division directors) shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission, report directly to it, and perform such functions and duties as the Commission may prescribe. (Sec. 205) Establishes within the CFTC the Office of the Chief Economist. (Sec. 206) Directs the CFTC to develop and publish internal procedures governing the issuance of any CFTC response to a formal, written request or petition from any member of the public for an exemptive, a no-action, or an interpretive letter.  Requires such procedures to require that the CFTC be provided with the final version of the matter to be issued in the response with sufficient notice to review it thoroughly before its issuance. (Sec. 207) Requires the CFTC to submit every five years to certain congressional committees a detailed strategic technology plan focused upon its acquisition and use of technology. Prescribes plan contents. (Sec. 208) Requires the CFTC to develop comprehensive internal risk control mechanisms to safeguard and govern the storage of all market data, including CFTC market data sharing agreements, and academic research performed at the CFTC using market data.  Requires the CFTC to submit to certain congressional committees two status reports regarding implementation of specified internal risk controls.

(Sec. 214) Prohibits compulsory CFTC disclosure of proprietary information provided to it; but denies any authorization for the CFTC to withhold information from Congress, upon an agreement of confidentiality. States this prohibition does not prevent:  CFTC compliance with a request for information from any federal agency or state, local, or foreign governmental entity requesting it for purposes within the scope of its jurisdiction, upon an agreement of confidentiality to protect the information; or CFTC disclosure pursuant to a court order in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding brought under this Act, in any receivership proceeding involving a receiver appointed in a judicial proceeding brought under this Act, or in any bankruptcy proceeding in which the CFTC has either intervened or in which it has the right to appear and be heard.

Title III: End-User Relief and Market Certainty Act - End-User Relief and Market Certainty Act - Subtitle A: End-User Exemption From Margin Requirements - (Sec. 311) Amends the CEA to exempt from prudential rules governing initial and variation margin requirements those swaps in which one of the counterparties: (1) is eligible for an exception from clearing requirements for certain significant price discovery agreements, contracts, or transactions in a commodity exempt from regulation by the CFTC, or an exemption from certain clearing requirements for cooperative entities; or (2) satisfies certain criteria for the treatment of affiliates. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) to exempt from prudential regulator and CFTC margin requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants any security-based swap in which a counterparty qualifies for an exception from clearing requirements or satisfies the criteria for an excepted affiliate. Subtitle B: Inter-Affiliate Swaps - (Sec. 321) Amends the CEA and the Act to revise the treatment of affiliate transactions that may be exempt from clearing requirements to authorize such an exemption only if the affiliate enters into the swap to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of the person that is not a financial entity (as under current law), provided that an appropriate credit support measure or other mechanism is used if the transfer of commercial risk is addressed by entering into: (1) a swap with either a swap dealer or major swap participant, or (2) a security-based swap with a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. Applies this subtitle only to swaps or security-based swaps entered into after enactment of this Act. Subtitle C: Indemnification Requirements Related to Swap Data Repositories - (Sec. 331) Amends the Act and the CEA to require that the CFTC, swap-data repositories, and security-based swap-data repositories, before sharing information with specified federal and foreign entities, receive a written agreement from each such entity stating that it will abide by specified confidentiality requirements regarding the information provided on their swap transactions.  Subtitle D: Relief for Municipal Utilities - (Sec. 341) Amends the CEA to prescribe reporting requirements for transactions in utility operations-related swaps. Requires the CFTC, in determining whether to exempt an entity that engages in a de minimis quantity of swap dealing, to treat a utility operations-related swap entered into with a utility special entity as if the entity were not a special entity. Subtitle E: End-User Regulatory Relief - (Sec. 351) Excludes from the definition of financial entity subject to clearing requirements specified entities that are not supervised by a prudential regulator, yet are commercial market participants deemed to be a financial entity because they: (1) predominantly engage in physical delivery contracts; or (2) enter into swaps, contracts for future delivery, and other derivatives on behalf of, or to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of affiliates that are not so supervised or described. (Sec. 352) Directs the CFTC to: (1) provide by rule for the public reporting of swap transactions in illiquid markets that are not cleared and entered into by a non-financial entity that is hedging or mitigating commercial risk; and (2) ensure that certain swap transaction information is publicly available no sooner than 30 days after the swap transaction has been executed, or at a later date appropriate to protect the identity of participants and positions in illiquid markets and to prevent the elimination or reduction of market liquidity. Defines \"illiquid market\" as any market in which the volume and frequency of trading in swaps is at such a level as to allow identification of individual market participants. (Sec. 353) Sets forth recordkeeping requirements for a member of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility that is neither registered with the CFTC nor required to be registered.  (Sec. 354) Excludes from the definition of “swap” any purchase or sale of a nonfinancial commodity or security for deferred shipment or delivery, so long as the transaction is intended to be physically settled (as under current law), including any stand-alone or embedded option: (1) for which exercise results in a physical delivery obligation, (2) which cannot be severed or marketed separately from the overall transaction for the purpose of financial settlement, and (3) in which both parties are commercial market participants.

Amends the Act to require the SEC, in consultation with the CFTC, to do the same with respect to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants.  (Sec. 357) Directs the CFTC to revise regulations regarding criteria that qualify certain registered commodity pool operators for exemption from requirements for specified risk disclosures, performance disclosures, periodic reporting, annual reporting, and recordkeeping. Alters one criterion for qualification for such exemptions currently granted to: (1) registered commodity pool operators who sell participations in a pool solely to qualified eligible persons in an offering which qualifies for exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and (2) certain banks registered as commodity pool operators in connection with a pool that is a collective trust fund whose securities are exempt from registration under the Securities Act.  (Sec. 358) Authorizes the CFTC to define a bona fide hedging transaction, consistent with certain CEA requirements.
