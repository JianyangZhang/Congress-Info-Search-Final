The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) constitutional rights should be upheld and protected, (2) Congress intends to uphold the constitutional principle of due process, and (3) due process of the law is a right afforded to everyone in the United States.  The bill expands the authority of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take a criminal alien into custody pending a determination of removability and provides that the alien, unless eligible for bond release, may be detained without limitation until subject to a final order of removal.  The Attorney General's review of DHS custody determinations is limited to whether the alien may be detained, released with no bond, or released on bond of at least $1,500. Review of DHS custody determinations for an alien in certain categories is limited to whether the alien was properly included in such category. The removal period begins on the latest of:   the date the removal order becomes administratively final;  the date the alien is taken into DHS custody if the alien is not in DHS custody on the date the removal order becomes administratively final; or  if the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process) on the date the removal order becomes administratively final, the date the alien is taken into DHS custody after the alien is released from detention or confinement.  The removal (and detention) period shall be extended beyond 90 days if:   the alien fails or refuses to comply with the removal order or to fully cooperate with DHS efforts to establish the alien's identity and carry out the removal order;  a court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or an immigration judge orders a stay of removal of an alien subject to a final removal order;  DHS transfers custody of the alien to another federal agency or to a state or local agency; or  a court or the Board of Immigration Appeals orders a remand to an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals while the case is pending a decision on remand.   In the case of such an extended removal, a new removal period shall begin on the date: (1) the alien makes all reasonable efforts to comply with the removal order or to cooperate fully with DHS efforts to establish the alien's identity and carry out the removal order, (2) the stay of removal is no longer in effect, or (3) the alien is returned to DHS custody. The bill requires mandatory detention for an alien who is inadmissible or deportable under specified criminal or terrorist grounds. DHS shall establish a detention review process for cooperative aliens. DHS may detain indefinitely, subject to six-month review, an alien under a removal order who cannot be removed if:   the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future;  the alien would have been removed but for his or her refusal to cooperate with DHS identification and removal efforts;  the alien has a highly contagious disease that poses a public safety threat;  release would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences or would threaten national security; or  release would threaten the safety of the community or any person and the alien has been convicted of either one or more aggravated felonies or crimes of violence and, because of a mental or personality condition, is likely to engage in future acts of violence.

The VA may prioritize vocational rehabilitation services based on need and upon consideration of disability ratings, the severity of employment handicaps, qualification for a program of independent living, income, and other appropriate factors.  Individuals may elect to convert their educational assistance to the Post-9/11 veterans' educational assistance program if, as of August 1, 2009, they meet specified conditions with respect to their entitlements and elections under the all-volunteer force educational assistance program or certain other educational programs for professional military, selected reserve, or reserve component members.  The bill prescribes transitional rules with respect to the transfer or revocation of entitlements from a previous assistance program after an election to convert to the Post-9/11 program.  Certain assistance shall remain available to individuals under their previous program if it is not available under the Post-9/11 program.  After January 1, 2016, if an individual submits an election that the VA determines is against the individual's interests, the VA may make an alternative election on the individual's behalf. Such an individual may, during a specified period, modify or revoke the VA's alternative selection.  The bill extends the period for certain qualifying work-study activities for individuals receiving VA educational assistance.  Specified education programs are deemed to be approved for veterans' education benefit purposes if a state approving agency determines that they qualify.  Licensure or certification program requirements necessary for VA approval are revised.

                "summary": "Water Resources Development Act of 2016 TITLE I--PROGRAM REFORMS (Sec. 1001) This bill amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986) to allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide technical assistance to nonfederal interests for feasibility studies of proposed water resources development projects if the nonfederal interest contracts to pay the costs of such assistance.  (Sec. 1002) The Corps of Engineers may receive and repay funds from states or political subdivisions for immediate use on authorized water resources development studies or projects (currently, only flood-control projects). The definition of \"state\" for such purposes is expanded to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, other U.S. territories or possessions, federally recognized Indian tribes, and other native entities.  (Sec. 1003) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to accept materials, services, or funds from a nonfederal public entity, a nonprofit entity, or a private entity to repair, restore, replace, or maintain a water resources project if there is a risk of adverse impacts to the functioning of the project. (Under current law, the Corps may accept only materials or services for repairing, restoring, or replacing such a project that has been damaged or destroyed as a result of an emergency.) (Sec. 1004) The Corps of Engineers may partner with nonfederal interests to maintain a project, but nonfederal interest partners are ineligible for reimbursement for their contributed materials, services, or funds.  (Sec. 1005) The Corps of Engineers may accept and expend funds provided by nonfederal interests to undertake reviews, inspections, monitoring, and other federal activities related to nonfederal interests carrying out the study, design, or construction of water resources development projects under WRDA 1986. In determining credit or reimbursement, the Corps may include the amount of such funds provided by a nonfederal interest as a cost of the study, design, or construction. (Sec. 1006) The Corps of Engineers' funding of response actions to address human health and environmental threats from military munitions deposited on a beach shall be reimbursed from amounts made available to the Department of Defense Agency responsible for the original release of the munitions. (Sec. 1007) The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 1992) is amended to authorize the Corps of Engineers to allow a nonfederal public or private entity that has entered into a cooperative agreement for the operation and management of recreation facilities and natural resources at civil works projects under the Corps' jurisdiction to collect user fees for the use of developed recreation sites and facilities, whether developed or constructed by such entity or the Corps. An entity may: (1) use any visitor reservation service that the Corps of Engineers has provided for by contract or interagency agreement to manage fee collections and reservations, subject to the Corps' terms and conditions; and (2) retain the fees collected to pay for operation, maintenance, and management at the recreation site where they were collected. (Sec. 1008) If a person or entity seeks permission from the Corps of Engineers for an occupation, use, or alteration of a harbor or river public works project that also requires review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) or another legal authority, the reviews and approvals shall occur concurrently to the extent practicable. If the Corps is not the lead federal agency for an environmental review, the Corps shall participate as a cooperating agency and use the same documents prepared under NEPA. The Corps of Engineers may accept funds from nonfederal public or private entities to evaluate an alteration, permanent occupation, or use of a work built by the United States. (Sec. 1009) To complete certain environmental infrastructure projects under WRDA 1992 that are already under construction (having received more than $4 million in federal appropriations when those appropriations are greater than 80% of the authorized amount), the bill increases authorized appropriations to allow completion of projects that have made significant progress if the benefits of the federal investment will not be realized without the increase. (Sec. 1010) The Flood Control Act of 1936 is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to receive funds from nonfederal interests without the current requirement that federal funds be appropriated for a study or project. The Corps may receive funds from nonfederal interests to formulate, review, or revise operational documents for a Corps-owned and -operated reservoir (other than reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river system, and the Stones River). (Sec. 1011) To analyze the benefits of offshore oil and gas fabrication port navigation projects authorized after November 7, 2007, the recommended plan by the Corps of Engineers must use the value of future energy exploration and production fabrication contracts and the transportation savings that would result from a larger navigation channel under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005. These requirements also apply to: (1) a project that has undergone an economic benefits update, and (2) ongoing feasibility studies at the request of a nonfederal sponsor. (Sec. 1012) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal interest's request, may review proposals to increase the quantity of available water supplies at federal water resources projects through: (1) modification of a water resources project, (2) modification of how a project is managed, or (3) access to water released from a project. But this section shall not apply to proposals that: (1) reallocate existing water supply or hydropower storage, or (2) reduce water available for any authorized project purpose. If a proposal relates to a federal project that is not owned by the Corps of Engineers, this section applies only to activities under the Corps' authority. The Corps of Engineers must comply with public participation requirements and provide a copy of proposals to federal agencies that own a project, affected states, power marketing administrations, and other entities with project rights or responsibilities. The Corps of Engineers shall not approve a proposal that: (1) is not supported by the federal agency that owns the project, (2) adversely impacts contractual or legal rights, (3) increases costs to other entities, (4) interferes with authorized project purposes, or (5) modifies federal statutory requirements without congressional authorization. The cost of developing, reviewing, and implementing a submitted proposal shall be provided by a nonfederal entity. But if an entity working with a state is authorized to receive Corps of Engineers' assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive plan, the Corps may use those funds to pay 50% of the cost of the entity's proposal review.  Special requirements are set forth for operation and maintenance costs relating to the construction of additional water supply storage at a reservoir for use under a water supply storage agreement.  Other entities may contribute to the costs of implementing a proposal.  The Corps of Engineers may provide technical assistance for a proposal if the nonfederal interest agrees to pay the costs of the assistance.

(Sec. 1036) The first $100,000 of a watershed assessment or feasibility study for a water resources project shall be a federal expense.  (Sec. 1037) The River and Harbor Act of 1968 is amended to provide for: (1) feasibility studies to be cost-shared in the same proportion as construction of projects, and (2) reimbursements to nonfederal interests if they expend more than their share of study costs.  (Sec. 1038) The title makes permanent a program that demonstrates the benefits of recreation facilities and activities at Corps of Engineers' lakes primarily in Oklahoma. (Sec. 1039) The estimated costs of the Corps of Engineers' water resources projects may affect cost-sharing responsibilities established by law.  (Sec. 1040) The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 is amended to make the tribal partnership program permanent and allow the Corps of Engineers to carry out cost-shared design and construction projects under the program. At an Indian tribe's request, the Corps of Engineers must report on the feasibility of a water resources development project or a project for the preservation of cultural and natural resources that will substantially benefit Indian tribes. The first $100,000 of such a study shall be at federal expense. The Corps of Engineers may carry out the design and construction of a feasible tribal partnership project if: (1) the federal share is not more than $10 million, or (2) congressional authorization is obtained for a federal share exceeding $10 million. The Corps of Engineers is prohibited from requiring an Indian tribe to waive its sovereign immunity as a condition to entering into a cost-sharing agreement under the tribal partnership program. The title sets forth the nonfederal cost shares for studies, design and construction, and watershed and river basin assessments under the expanded program.  (Sec. 1041) WRDA 1986 is amended to extend the waiver of up to $200,000 for local cost-sharing requirements in U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands) to planning assistance and Indian tribes. The waiver applies to comprehensive plans under the Water Resources Development Act of 1974. (Sec. 1042) The Corps of Engineers, with the consent of nonfederal sponsors, may enter into cost-sharing agreements under the Flood Control Act of 1970 to allow local governments in a watershed that has adopted a local or regional water management plan to participate in feasibility studies. (Sec. 1043) The Corps of Engineers' authority to provide nonfederal interests a credit in lieu of a reimbursement for the estimated federal share of a flood damage reduction project under repealed provisions the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (WRDA 1996) is extended to projects for which a written agreement with the Corps for construction was finalized on or before December 31, 2014. (Currently, the credit in lieu of reimbursement is limited to projects that have been constructed by a nonfederal interest before the provisions were repealed on June 10, 2014.) The credit may be applied to other water resources development projects or studies of the nonfederal interest.  (Sec. 1044) Study costs incurred before execution of a feasibility cost-sharing agreement for an aquatic ecosystem restoration project under WRDA 1996 shall be federal costs if: (1) the study was initiated before October 1, 2006, and (2) the feasibility cost-sharing agreement was not executed before January 1, 2014.

(Sec. 1048) The Corps of Engineers may accept requests and funding from nonfederal entities and federal power marketing agencies to review, and update if appropriate, flood control rule curves and water operations manuals for reservoirs constructed with federal funds and regulated by the Corps for storage in western states with Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects in areas: (1) with prolonged droughts, or (2) for which no review has occurred during the previous 10 years. The Corps of Engineers must enter agreements with affected states, reservoir owners or operators, and (if requested) nonfederal entities responsible for operation and maintenance costs before carrying out such activities. This section does not apply to the Boulder Canyon project, initial units of the Colorado River storage project, Reclamation dam or reservoir project facilities operated and maintained by the Department of the Interior (unless requested by all nonfederal project sponsors), Corps of Engineers-owned and -operated dams or reservoirs, or Reclamation project facilities operated and maintained by nonfederal entities under a transfer contract (unless requested by the organization contractually responsible for operation and maintenance). It also sets forth requirements for public participation and the protection of existing rights. (Sec. 1049) States, body politics deriving power from a state constitution, or government entities created by a state legislature may require that their partnership agreements with the Corps of Engineers to construct water resources projects do not obligate future appropriations for performance and payment that would be inconsistent with constitutional or statutory limitations of the state or a local government. (Sec. 1050) The maximum cost of a project must be increased automatically for changes in construction costs applied to unconstructed features based on actual appreciation in relevant real estate markets. The Corps of Engineers may accept in-kind contributions, land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas (currently, the Corps may accept only funds) from a nonfederal interest for any authorized water resources development project that has exceeded its maximum cost if the use of such contributions does not increase the federal share of the project cost. But these accepted funds and other contributions are not eligible for credit or repayment and shall not be included in the total cost of the project. (Sec. 1051) The title establishes procedures to continue or make permanent under the Water Supply Act of 1958 certain water supply agreements that were predicated on water that was surplus to a deauthorized purpose and that provided for: (1) contingent permanent storage rights, or (2) complete payment of the actual investment costs of storage to be used in the case of an agreement with a duration of at least 30 years.

(Sec. 2008) The Corps of Engineers may use sediment from other federal and nonfederal sources, but any nonfederal source sediment must be obtained without federal expense. Federal water resources projects involving the disposal of dredged material may include a single or periodic application of sediment for beneficial use and shall not require operation and maintenance. The Corps may accept funds from a nonfederal interest to dispose of such dredged material for private shores or lands that are ineligible for federal cost sharing. (Sec. 2009) The bill makes permanent: (1) the requirement that the Corps of Engineers allocate for emerging harbor projects at least 10% percent of the funds made available under the HMTF for FY2015 (currently FY2012) to pay the operation and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of all harbors and inland harbors within the United States, and (2) the Corps' authority to provide funds to donor ports and energy transfer ports.  (Sec. 2010) The bill revises methods of: (1) allocating payments to donor ports and energy transfer ports through the establishment of a new category of medium-sized donor ports that are eligible for funding if they annually collect between $5 million and $15 million of total HMTF funding (donor ports must currently collect at least $15 million annually to be eligible), and (2) transferring through U.S. Customs and Border Protection payments that ports elect to provide to importers or shippers by specifying that the process applies to discretionary cargo (maritime cargo destined for inland locations that can be economically shipped through multiple seaports located in different countries or regions) that is shipped through eligible ports and most at risk of diversion to seaports outside the United States. The Corps of Engineers must limit payments to top importers or shippers through an eligible port, as ranked by value of discretionary cargo.  (Sec. 2011) The bill extends to contracts for physical construction that have not been awarded before enactment of WRRDA 2014 the formula that calculates the harbor deepening costs to be paid by nonfederal interests during construction for harbor or inland harbor navigation projects. For the portion of a project that has a depth in excess of 45 feet but not in excess of 50 feet, the cost to be paid by nonfederal interests is decreased from 50% to 25% of the cost of construction for that portion. (Sec. 2012) The Corps of Engineers must carry out dredging activities on shallow draft ports located on the inland Mississippi River to the authorized widths and depths. (Sec. 2013) The Corps of Engineers must publish guidance for the implementation of WRRDA 2014 provisions concerning maintenance of emerging ports and Great Lakes ports. (Sec. 2014) The Corps of Engineers' justification for a harbor and navigation improvements project may include the long-term viability of a community that is located in the region that is served by, and that will rely on, the project. (Sec. 2015) The Corps of Engineers may permit a nonfederal interest to carry out maintenance activities necessary to ensure that a navigation project is maintained to not less than the minimum project dimensions. Costs incurred by the nonfederal interest are eligible for reimbursement up to the estimated federal cost, but are limited to costs directly related to the performance of work for the federal government and the actual fiscal year appropriations for that portion of maintenance dredging. In carrying out the maintenance activities, the nonfederal interest shall: (1) provide equipment at no cost to the federal government, and (2) hold the United States free from damages that arise from the use of the equipment. This section terminates 10 years after enactment of this bill.  (Sec. 2016) The Corps of Engineers' next biennial HMTF report on operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors and inland harbors must identify transportation cost savings realized by achieving and maintaining the constructed width and depth for such harbors on a project-by-project basis. This requirement does not apply to subsequent reports. (Sec. 2017) The Corps of Engineers may place dredged material from the operation and maintenance of an authorized federal water resources project at another authorized water resource project if, for a reasonable cost, the placement would: (1) enhance protection from flooding caused by storm surges or sea level rise, or (2) significantly contribute to shoreline resiliency or wetland restoration. The Corps shall not require a nonfederal entity to bear any increased costs associated with the placement of dredged material at another project if it exceeds the cost of depositing the dredged material in accordance with federal regulations. (Sec. 2018) The bill makes permanent the Corps of Engineers' authority to use available priority funds (the difference between funds made available for operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors under WRDA 1986 each fiscal year and those funds made available for FY2012) for high- and moderate-use harbor projects and emerging harbor projects, including those within the Great Lakes Navigation System.  (Sec. 2019) The Corps of Engineers must allocate funding made available to the Corps from the HMTF in accordance with the criteria and priority percentages under WRDA 1986 concerning expenditures for operation and maintenance of harbor projects. TITLE III--SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS (Sec. 3001) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal sponsor's request, may use the natural disaster emergency fund to repair or restore flood control work, hurricane or shore protective structures, or the depths of federal navigable channels or waterways to an increased pumping capacity or a level of protection above the system design. The nonfederal sponsor must agree to pay the difference between the cost of restoration to the original design level and the cost of achieving the higher level of protection. The Corps must notify nonfederal sponsors of the opportunity to request nonstructural alternatives to restore or protect natural resources (including streams, rivers, floodplains, wetlands, or coasts) if those efforts will reduce flood risk. (Sec. 3002) The bill authorizes a temporary program for the Corps of Engineers to address consolidation, settlement, subsidence, sea level rise, and new data to restore federally authorized hurricane and storm damage reduction projects through cost-share agreements with nonfederal partners. (Sec. 3003) If the Corps of Engineers has assumed (as of the enactment of this bill) responsibility for maintenance of a high risk flood control project, the Corps must continue to be responsible for such maintenance until the project is modified to reduce the risk, or until 15 years after enactment of this bill, whichever is earlier.  (Sec. 3004) The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a program to provide technical, planning, design, and construction assistance grants to nonfederal sponsors (subject to a nonfederal cost-sharing requirement of at least 35%) for rehabilitation of eligible high hazard potential dams.  An \"eligible high hazard potential dam\" is a nonfederal dam that:  is located in a state with a state dam safety program, is classified as high hazard potential by the dam safety agency of the state in which the dam is located, has an emergency action plan approved by such agency, and fails to meet minimum state dam safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public.   An eligible high hazard potential dam does not include a licensed hydroelectric dam or a dam built under the authority of the Department of Agriculture (USDA).  FEMA shall require a grant recipient to provide an assurance that the owner of the dam has developed and will carry out a plan for maintenance of the dam during its expected life. A grant must be approved by the relevant state dam safety agency.  Grant funds shall be allocated to all states from which applications are submitted based on each state's relative number of eligible high hazard potential dams compared to all states.  Grant funds may not be used to:   rehabilitate a federal dam, perform routine operation or maintenance of a dam, modify a dam to produce hydroelectric power, increase water supply storage capacity, or make any other modification that does not also improve the safety of the dam.   The bill sets forth requirements and conditions for nonfederal sponsors to receive such grants, including the demonstration of a floodplain management plan to reduce the impacts of future flood events.  (Sec. 3005) The Corps of Engineers must expedite completion of flood damage reduction and flood risk management projects for:  Chicagoland Underflow Plan, Illinois, phase 2; Cedar River, Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Comite River, Louisiana; and Amite River and Tributaries, Louisiana.   (Sec. 3006) Repair costs to correct a seepage problem at a dam in the Cumberland River Basin (for projects for which construction has not yet begun and appropriations have not been made as of this bill's enactment) must be: (1) treated as costs for a dam safety project, and (2) subject to cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 1986. (Sec. 3007) This bill establishes the High-Hazard Indian Dam Safety Deferred Maintenance Fund and the Low-Hazard Indian Dam Safety Deferred Maintenance Fund. The Department of the Treasury must make deposits to these funds at least monthly until the funds are terminated at the end of FY2037. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) must establish a program to address the deferred maintenance needs of Indian dams that create flood risks or other risks to safety, natural resources, or cultural resources and impede the management and efficiency of Indian dams. To be eligible, a dam must be federally owned and included in the BIA's Safety of Dams program. The low hazard fund and high hazard fund must be used to pay for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities for dams classified under guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as low hazard and significant or high hazard, respectively. The BIA must: (1) develop programmatic goals and prioritization criteria before expending funds; (2) prioritize dams that serve more than one tribe or highly populated Indian communities; (3) consult with landowners served by the dam before expending funds, except in emergencies; and (4) ensure that, each year, every dam in need of critical maintenance receives funding.  The Department of the Interior must establish in the BIA the Tribal Safety of Dams Committee to study the modernization of the Indian Dams Safety Act of 1994 and develop recommendations for legislation to improve that Act. The BIA must: (1) request that Indian tribes report on dams on their land at least once every 180 days, and (2) report on each dam under BIA jurisdiction at least once each year. The BIA must establish a flood plain management pilot program to provide, upon request, guidance to Indians tribes on best practices for the mitigation and prevention of floods. The program is funded through the funds for high- and low-hazard dams and is terminated four years after enactment of this bill. (Sec. 3008) The Corps of Engineers may carry out feasible cost-sharing projects with nonfederal entities to rehabilitate nonfederally operated dams classified by states as posing a high hazard potential if the dams were: (1) constructed, in whole or in part, by the Corps for flood control purposes; and (2) completed before 1940. The Corps shall not expend more than $10 million for a project at any single dam.  TITLE IV--RIVER BASINS, WATERSHEDS, AND COASTAL AREAS (Sec. 4001) The Corps of Engineers must coordinate with Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to develop a recovery plan for Gulf Coast oyster beds damaged by: (1) Hurricane Katrina in 2005, (2) the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, and (3) floods in 2011 and 2016. (Sec. 4002) The bill: (1) increases funding for ecosystem restoration projects for the lower Columbia River and Tillamook Bay estuaries in Oregon and Washington; (2) allows watercraft inspection stations to be established to protect against aquatic plant growths and invasive species in the Platte and Arkansas river basins and in additional locations of the Columbia River Basin; (3) addresses replacement housing for Indian families displaced by the construction of the Bonneville Dam and the John Day Dam; and (4) requires the Corps of Engineers to determine the feasibility of modifying projects to address safety risks for navigation of Columbia and Lower Willamette Rivers below Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.  (Sec. 4003) The Corps of Engineers, in partnership with the Department of the Interior, must carry out a pilot program to implement sediment management plans for Corps-owned and -operated reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River Basin, on request by project beneficiaries. The program may also apply to reservoirs managed or owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Corps of Engineers shall be the lead agency for soil moisture and snowpack monitoring projects in the Upper Missouri River Basin. (Sec. 4004) The bill increases the portion of the amount of appropriations authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 for critical ecosystem restoration projects in the area of Puget Sound, Washington, that may be used to carry out a single project.  (Sec. 4005) The Corps of Engineers may carry out small flood control pilot projects with Corps laboratories, universities, government agencies, and private organizations to prevent and mitigate flood damages associated with ice jams. Priority must be given to the Upper Missouri River Basin. (Sec. 4006) The bill increases authorized appropriations for alternative or beneficially modified habitats for fish and wildlife, including native oysters in the Chesapeake Bay. (Sec. 4007) The Corps of Engineers' study to determine the feasibility of projects to restore aquatic ecosystems within the coastal waters of the northeastern United States from Virginia to Maine must be developed as a comprehensive assessment and management plan at federal expense. (Sec. 4008) The bill reauthorizes through FY2024 the Rio Grande Basin fish and wildlife habitat program in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. (Sec. 4009) The Corps of Engineers must consider information developed by the Gulf Coast Community Protection and Recovery District to expedite completion of the coastal Texas ecosystem protection and restoration study. (Sec. 4010) The Corps of Engineers must conduct a study at federal expense to determine the feasibility of projects to address systemic flood damage reduction in the upper Mississippi and Illinois River basins. (Sec. 4011) The pilot designation is removed from California's Salton Sea restoration projects. Additional nonfederal interests may participate in cost sharing for these projects. (Sec. 4012) The list of South Carolina counties with nonfederal interests eligible for assistance with water treatment and distribution projects for Marion and Moultrie Lakes under WRDA 1992 is adjusted to add Berkeley County and remove Sumter County. (Sec. 4013) Corps of Engineers' studies to determine the feasibility of Corps projects in coastal zones to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency must prioritize projects in communities whose existence is threatened by rising sea level. An interagency working group must be convened on extreme weather and sea level rise to: (1) coordinate research and federal investments; (2) participate in state authorized studies; and (3) share physical, biological, and socioeconomic data among state organizations.  (Sec. 4014) The Corps of Engineers must report on regional assessments of coastal and back bay protection. (Sec. 4015) The Corps of Engineers must study coastal areas within the geographical boundaries of its South Atlantic Division to identify the risks and vulnerabilities to increased hurricane and storm damage as a result of sea level rise. It must: (1) develop a long-term strategy to enhance resiliency, increase sustainability, and lower risks in populated areas, areas of concentrated economic development, and areas with vulnerable environmental resources; and (2) report within four years after enactment of this bill with recommendations to address those risks and vulnerabilities.  (Sec. 4016) The Corps of Engineers must study the feasibility of implementing projects for flood risk management, ecosystem restoration, navigation, water supply, recreation, and water resource related purposes within the Kanawha River Basin in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. (Sec. 4017) In developing projects for coastal risk reduction, the Corps of Engineers must consider: (1) natural features created through physical, geological, biological, and chemical processes over time; (2) human-designed, natural-based features engineered and constructed to protect in concert with natural processes; and (3) nonstructural and structural measures. (Sec. 4018) The Department of Commerce must designate as a resilient waterfront community a unit of local government or Indian tribe that meets specified criteria and is:  bound in part by a Great Lake or an ocean or bordered or traversed by a riverfront or an inland lake; self-nominated as a resilient waterfront community; and designated as one by Commerce on the basis of a community-developed plan.   In making such a designation for inland lake and riverfront communities, Commerce must work with the Environmental Protection Agency and the heads of other federal agencies as necessary.  A resilient waterfront community plan is a community-driven vision and plan developed:  voluntarily at the discretion of the community to respond to local needs or take advantage of new water-oriented opportunities; with the leadership of the relevant governmental entity or Indian tribe and the active participation of community residents, utilities, and interested business and nongovernmental stakeholders; in consideration of all applicable state and federal coastal zone management planning; to address economic competitive strengths; and to complement and incorporate the objectives and recommendations of regional economic plans.   A resilient waterfront community plan shall consider all, or a portion of, the waterfront area and adjacent land and water to which it is connected ecologically, economically, or through local governmental or tribal boundaries and integrate consideration of:  the economic opportunities resulting from water proximity and access and the community's relationship to the water; ecosystem challenges and projections, including extreme weather and water conditions; infrastructure needs and opportunities to facilitate specified strategic and sustainable capital investments; and such other factors that align with metrics or indicators for resiliency, considering environmental and economic changes.   After the designation of a resilient waterfront community, its plan may be effective for a 10-year period.  Commerce must: (1) develop and maintain a resilient waterfront communities network to facilitate the sharing of best practices among waterfront communities; and (2) recognize such communities formally and publicly to promote tourism, investment, or other benefits.

The bill establishes the Pechanga Settlement Fund, which is to be used to carry out this section. Interior is not liable for failing to carry out any obligation or activity under this section if there are insufficient appropriations. (Sec. 8010) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the EPA should receive and expeditiously process tort claims for injury arising out of the Gold King Mine release on August 5, 2015, that discharged contaminated water north of Silverton, Colorado, into Cement Creek while EPA contractors were conducting an investigation to assess mine conditions. The bill establishes procedures for processing eligible response cost claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The EPA must implement a program for long-term water quality monitoring of rivers contaminated by the Gold King Mine release. (Sec. 8011) The GAO must report within five years after this bill's enactment on: (1) the Columbia River Basin restoration program, and (2) watercraft inspection stations' effectiveness in preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species at Corps of Engineers-operated reservoirs. (Sec. 8012) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) state water quality standards that impact the disposal of dredged material should be developed collaboratively, (2) open-water disposal of dredged material should be reduced, and (3) disputes between states related to the disposal of dredged material and the protection of water quality should be resolved in accordance with regional plans and the involvement of regional bodies. (Sec. 8013) Interior is prohibited (for five years after enactment of this bill) from increasing permit fees for cabins or trailers on North Dakota land administered by Reclamation's Dakotas Area Office by more than 33% of the permit fee that was in effect on January 1, 2016. (Sec. 8014) Reclamation must use the same permit renewal process for trailer area permits at Heart Butte Dam and Reservoir (Lake Tschida) as it uses for other permit renewals in other reservoirs in North Dakota administered by its Dakotas Area Office. The bill sets forth: (1) requirements for trailer homes, campers, and recreational vehicles; and (2) procedures for permit transfers, replacement and anchoring of trailer homes, and removal of flooded trailer homes. The United States shall not be liable for flood damage to the personal property of a permittee or for damages arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence relating to a lot to which a permit applies. Any temporary flooding or flood damage to the personal property of a permittee shall not be a taking by the United States. TITLE IX--BLACKFEET WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT Blackfeet Water Rights Settlement Act (Sec. 9004) This bill authorizes, ratifies, and confirms the water rights compact between the Blackfeet Tribe and Montana dated April 15, 2009, as modified to be consistent with this title. (Sec. 9005) The Blackfeet Tribe and the Fort Belknap Indian Community must enter into an agreement on their Milk River water rights. The Department of the Interior must approve the agreement if it equitably accommodates the interests of each tribe. Interior may establish terms and conditions for the Milk River water rights if an agreement between the tribes is not approved by a certain date. (Sec. 9006) The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) must enter into at least one water delivery contract with the Blackfeet Tribe for water from the St. Mary River water right delivered through Milk River Project facilities. The tribe has the right to the remaining portion of U.S. St. Mary River water rights after all other rights are satisfied. (Sec. 9007) Interior must conduct studies in cooperation with the Blackfeet Tribe and Montana regarding St. Mary River and Milk River water supplies, rehabilitation of the St. Mary Diversion Dam and Canal, increased storage in Fresno Dam and Reservoir, and use of the Milk River Project. The USBR must review the final project design of the Swiftcurrent Creek Bank Stabilization Project and negotiate with the tribe any changes to the design prior to beginning construction. At the request of the tribe, USBR must enter agreements with the tribe to carry out the project. The tribe must grant the United States easements and rights-of-way for the Milk River Project and other construction described in this title. (Sec. 9008) The USBR is granted exclusive jurisdiction to authorize the development of St. Mary Unit hydroelectric power. The tribe is granted the exclusive right to develop and market such power. Before construction of a hydroelectric power generation project, the tribe must enter into an agreement with the USBR that includes specified provisions. (Sec. 9009) Interior must allocate water stored in Lake Elwell for the tribe. The tribe may use the water or enter into agreements for use of the water. Under an agreement, the water must be used within the Missouri River Basin and no portion of the water may be permanently alienated. (Sec. 9010) The USBR must carry out: (1) deferred maintenance related to the Blackfeet Irrigation Project; (2) dam safety improvements for Four Horns Dam; and (3) rehabilitation and enhancement of the Four Horns Feeder Canal, Dam, and Reservoir. Ownership of Birch Creek water delivery facilities is transferred to the tribe. (Sec. 9011) In accordance with agreements with the tribe, the USBR must construct: (1) the water diversion and delivery features of the Blackfeet Regional Water System; (2) facilities to store water and support irrigation on the tribe’s reservation; and (3) construction described in the report “Blackfeet Water Storage, Development, and Project Report,” dated March 13, 2013. Ownership of these facilities is granted to the tribe, except ownership of the Birch Creek Unit of the Blackfeet Indian Irrigation Project. (Sec. 9014) Land within the tribe’s reservation acquired by the tribe or by the United States must be held in trust for the tribe. (Sec. 9015) Tribal water rights are ratified, confirmed, declared to be valid, and held in trust. Members of the tribe with an allotment of trust land (allottees) are entitled to water for irrigation, which must be satisfied from the tribal water rights. The tribe may allocate, distribute, and lease tribal water rights for off-reservation use, subject to Interior approval. The tribe must establish a tribal water code, subject to Interior approval. The tribe may not permanently alienate any portion of its tribal water rights. (Sec. 9016) The bill establishes the Blackfeet Settlement Trust Fund. Interior must make specified deposits to the fund. The tribe may make withdrawals from the fund in accordance with this title and a tribal management plan or expenditure plan that has been approved by Interior. (Sec. 9017) The bill establishes the Blackfeet Water Settlement Implementation Fund for use by Interior to carry out this title. (Sec. 9019) The instream flow water rights of the tribe within the Lewis and Clark National Forest and Glacier National Park are confirmed as described in “Stipulation to Address Claims by and for the Benefit of the Blackfeet Indian Tribe to Water Rights in the Lewis &amp; Clark National Forest and Glacier National Park.” (Sec. 9020) The tribe and the United States (acting as trustee for the tribe) must waive all claims to water rights in Montana, except water rights recognized in the compact and this title. The United States, acting as trustee for allottees, must waive all claims to water rights within the tribe’s reservation, except water rights recognized in the compact and this title. The tribe must: (1) waive claims against the United States regarding specified water rights, land, and facilities; and (2) withdraw objections to U.S. water rights claims for the benefit of the Milk River Project. The waivers in this title are enforceable on the date Interior publishes specified findings regarding appropriations, waivers, and approved agreements. If Interior does not publish those findings on or before January 21, 2025, or a later date agreed upon by the tribe and Interior, the provisions of this title expire and related actions and agreements are void. If appropriations are not made on or before January 21, 2026, the waivers expire and the United States’ approval of the compact is no longer effective. (Sec. 9024) The United States is not liable for failing to carry out any obligation or activity under this title if there are insufficient appropriations.",
