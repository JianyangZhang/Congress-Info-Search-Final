For the child nutrition programs, the bill makes policy changes that:   establish a demonstration project to permit up to three states to receive a block grant instead of open-ended funding currently provided by several child nutrition programs;  require the Department of Agriculture to review school meal regulations every three years and make any necessary revisions;   increase reimbursement rates for the School Breakfast Program;   increase the eligibility threshold for participation in the Community Eligibility Provision that permits schools in high poverty areas to serve all meals free of charge;   permit states to provide summer meals away from a congregate site (specific sites where children come to eat and are supervised) in rural or low-income areas without access to summer service; and  revise application verification requirements for the school meal programs.   For WIC, the bill:   authorizes appropriations at the current FY2016 level for the next five years,  permits commercial availability and participant demand to be considered when amending the list of supplemental foods, and   modifies the competitive bidding and contract award process for infant formula and infant foods.

The bill specifies how an employee or applicant may seek a remedy under specified employment protection statutes with respect to an adverse personnel action.  The bill permits an agency to suspend an employee for misconduct or poor performance.

A grievance filed on behalf of such employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement that results in an increased performance rating for such employee may not result in a pay raise.

An agency may transfer an individual occupying a Senior Executive Service position who is not an at-will employee to a position within the General Schedule.

The bill specifies permissible uses for the funds and designates the funds as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits. The emergency funding is only available if the President also designates the amounts as an emergency requirement.  The bill provides appropriations to HHS for:    the Food and Drug Administration,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,   the National Institutes of Health, and  the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund.  The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit Project BioShield to be used to support the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any infectious disease that may pose a threat to the public health. (Under current law, Project BioShield supports only countermeasures against specific chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear terrorist threats.)  The bill provides funds for HHS to award grants to U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands) for the purpose of combating the Zika virus.  The bill provides appropriations to the Department of State for:    the Administration of Foreign Affairs,  the U.S. Agency for International Development, Bilateral Economic Assistance,  International Security Assistance, and Multilateral Assistance.

Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to allow states that have established a program allowing the parents of disabled children to use public or private funds to send their children to a private school to use their allocation of special education funds to supplement those funds. Authorizes grants for the improvement of special education services to be used for the planning, design, and initial implementation, during a period of up to three years, of state programs that allow the parents of a disabled child to make a genuine independent choice of the appropriate public or private school for their child. Sets forth requirements for those programs, including that they: (1) permit parents to receive state funds to pay some or all of the costs of their disabled child's attendance at the selected school, or (2) permit persons to receive a state tax credit for donations to an entity that provides funds to enable parents to pay some or all of the costs of their disabled child's attendance at that school.

Expands the definition of \"education records\" to include student records that are: (1) maintained electronically or digitally; (2) accessible or collected by service providers, contractors, or other parties; or (3) created by or for a state educational authority, without regard to whether the student attends a school under the jurisdiction of such state educational authority.  Allows educational agencies or institutions to disclose education records without parental consent to education service providers, contractors, or other parties to whom institutional services have been outsourced, provided that the party agrees to secure information from unauthorized access and be subject to penalties for violations.  Permits disclosure of education records without parental consent to authorized representatives of the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Education (ED), state or local educational authorities, or the Department of Justice (DOJ) for: (1) audits, evaluations, or enforcement of local, state, or federal laws; (2) audits or evaluations of locally supported, state supported, or federally supported education programs pursuant to local, state, or federal laws; or (3) enforcement of federal or state legal requirements related to such programs. Removes restrictions on disclosures to state and local authorities to whom information is specifically allowed to be reported or disclosed pursuant to a state statute regarding the juvenile justice system.  Limits the types of studies that organizations may conduct with student records disclosed without parental consent to studies used to improve academic outcomes of students attending the educational agency or institution. Establishes conditions under which college exam developers may release information collected during or based on the administration of an exam for college admissions, placements, credits, or scholarships.
