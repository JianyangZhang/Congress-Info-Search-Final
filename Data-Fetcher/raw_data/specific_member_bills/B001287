Cost sharing for a preventive health service provided by an out-of-network provider shall not be imposed if a woman does not have an in-network provider with the capacity to provide the service. For a preventive health service that varies based on the patient's risk of disease, a woman must be treated as being at high risk for a disease if she has a family history of the disease or if a health care provider determines she is at high risk.
