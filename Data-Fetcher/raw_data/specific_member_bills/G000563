The EPA must provide technical assistance to the municipalities or states for developing an integrated plan upon request. The EPA must: (1) update its financial capability assessment guidance entitled, \"Combined Sewer Overflows--Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and Schedule Development,\" and dated February 1997; and (2) ensure that the guidance may be used for assessing the financial capability of municipalities to implement effluent limitations and other pollution control measures.
