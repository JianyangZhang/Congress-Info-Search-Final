States may only make loans for grocery stores that meet requirements related to:    emphasizing unprocessed, healthful foods;  providing staple foods and a variety of raw fruits and vegetables;   having a plan to keep the foods in stock;  charging prices at or below market averages; meeting specified matching requirements using non-federal funds; and being qualified to operate a store or having partnerships with organizations that provide technical assistance.   States must prioritize loan applications from entities that meet criteria related to:   hiring workers from the underserved community,   providing classes or educational information about a healthful diet,  sourcing food from local urban farms and gardens,  not selling alcohol or tobacco products, or demonstrating existing supply chain relationships or expertise in the grocery industry.

States must use the funds to make loans to support grocery stores in underserved communities, including for:    opening a store (excluding new construction),   supporting an existing store,   purchasing an existing store, or   supporting a store located in a community that would be underserved without the store.   States may only make loans for qualified grocery stores that:    emphasize unprocessed, healthful foods;  provide staple foods and a variety of raw fruits and vegetables;   have a plan to keep the foods in stock; and  charge prices at or below municipal averages.   States must prioritize loan applications from entities that meet criteria, including:    hiring workers from the underserved community,   providing classes or educational information about a healthful diet,  sourcing food from local urban farms and gardens,  not selling alcohol or tobacco products, or demonstrating existing supply chain relationships or expertise in the grocery industry.
