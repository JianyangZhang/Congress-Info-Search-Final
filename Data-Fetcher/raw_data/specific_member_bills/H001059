For taxpayers that are not a corporation or a partnership with a corporation as a partner, the bill repeals the annual limitation on the election to expense certain depreciable business assets.

TITLE II--FAIR ACCESS TO INVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sec. 201) The SEC shall revise a specified regulation to create a safe harbor for certain publications or distributions of research reports by brokers or dealers distributing securities.  The revised regulation shall declare that, even if a broker or dealer participates in the registered offering of a covered investment fund's securities, the investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale nor an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to a registration statement that the issuer proposes to file, or has filed, or that is effective.  The covered investment fund research report shall be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization.  The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  TITLE III--SMALL BUSINESS MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, SALES, AND BROKERAGE SIMPLIFICATION (Sec. 301) The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to exempt from its registration requirements certain merger and acquisition brokers and associated persons.  This registration exemption, however, shall be denied to brokers who:  receive, hold, transmit, or have custody of any funds or securities to be exchanged by parties to a transfer of ownership of an eligible privately held company; engage on behalf of an issuer in a public offering of securities that are either subject to mandatory registration, or with respect to which the issuer must file periodic information, documents, and reports; or engage on behalf of any party in a transaction involving a public shell company.  A broker shall not be exempt from registration if the broker is subject to:  a suspension or revocation of registration; a specified statutory disqualification; a disqualification under certain rules adopted by the SEC under the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010; or a final order of a state securities commission, a state financial institution supervisory authority, a federal banking agency, or the National Credit Union Administration.   This Act may not be construed to limit any other authority of the SEC to exempt any person, or any class of persons, from any provision of this Act, including any related rule or regulation.  TITLE IV--SMALL COMPANY DISCLOSURE SIMPLIFICATION (Sec. 401) The bill exempts emerging growth companies and issuers with total annual gross revenues of less than $250 million from the requirement to use Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for financial statements and other mandatory periodic reporting filed with the SEC. Such companies, however, may elect to use XBRL for such reporting.  (Sec. 402) The SEC shall: (1) analyze the costs and benefits to such issuers of the requirement to use XBRL for financial statements and other mandatory periodic reporting; and (2) report to certain congressional committees on the results of such analysis as well as on progress in implementing XBRL reporting within the SEC, and use of XBRL data by the SEC and by investors.  TITLE V--STREAMLINING EXCESSIVE AND COSTLY REGULATIONS REVIEW (Sec. 501) Within 5 years after enactment of this Act, and thereafter at least once within each 10-year period, the SEC shall:  review each significant regulation it has issued; determine by vote whether it is ineffective, excessively burdensome, unnecessary, or inconsistent with its mandate; solicit public comment as to whether the regulation should be amended or repealed; and subsequently amend or repeal accordingly.   The SEC shall report to certain congressional committees the steps it has taken to implement the results of its decision, including any action to amend or repeal the target regulation.  The bill declares that SEC determinations made pursuant to this Act are final and not subject to judicial review. ",

The bill expedites the approval process for:   a health-flex waiver from requirements for qualified health plans and essential health benefits; and  an exchange waiver to assume responsibility for certain functions of the exchanges, including the certification of permissible health plans.  If a state submits to HHS a notice of its intent to implement one or both of the waivers, the waivers shall be deemed to be approved and effective. The notice must include the years for which the waiver shall be effective (which may be indefinite), an assurance the state will comply with reporting requirements, and other specified details.  A state may not waive PPACA requirements related to coverage for preexisting conditions and the extension of coverage for adult children.  States with exchange waivers may certify permissible health plans that residents may purchase outside of an exchange, if the plans meet specified requirements regarding benefits, levels of coverage, transparency of premium justifications, and information.
