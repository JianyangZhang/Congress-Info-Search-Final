                "summary": "Red River Private Property Protection Act  (Sec. 2) This bill declares that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the Department of the Interior disclaims any right, title, and interest to certain lands along a stretch of the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma (the affected area) located south of the South Bank boundary line.   BLM surveys conducted before enactment of this Act shall have no force or effect in determining the South Bank boundary line.  (Sec. 3) The BLM, in identifying the current South Bank boundary line along the affected area, shall commission a new survey that: (1) adheres to the gradient boundary survey method, (2) spans the entire length of the affected area, (3) is conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors chosen by the Texas General Land Office and each affected federally recognized Indian tribe, and (4) is completed within two years of enactment of this Act.  The survey, including surveys of individual parcels, shall be submitted to the Texas General Land Office, not to the BLM, for approval, in consultation with the Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office and each affected federally recognized Indian tribe.   The Texas Land Office shall notify the BLM of its approval of a survey, together with a copy and related field notes.   The BLM, after receiving this notification, shall notify the landowners adjacent to the surveyed parcel, together with a copy and related field notes.  (Sec. 4) A landowner who receives such a notification and who claims to hold right, title, or interest in the affected area may appeal the survey's determination to an Administrative Law Judge of the Department of the Interior.  A landowner who files such an appeal and is adversely affected by the final decision may file a civil action in the U.S. district court for the district in which the person resides or in which the affected area is located.  (Sec. 5) If the BLM determines that a surveyed parcel is not subject to appeal or judicial review, it shall notify federally recognized Indian tribes with jurisdiction over lands adjacent to the parcel that it shall accept patent applications for that parcel for 210 days. The BLM shall also check at least once every six months the status of any appeals or further judicial reviews related to a parcel that is subject to appeal or further judicial review until it is no longer subject to appeal or further judicial review.   The BLM may issue to an applicant, on the payment of fair market value per acre, a patent for the surface rights to a parcel of identified federal lands that the applicant (or the applicant's ancestors or grantors) have held in good faith and in peaceful adverse possession for more than 20 years under a claim (including through a state land grant). Such a patent shall:  reserve to the United States all minerals contained in the parcel, which shall be subject to sale or disposal under leasing and mineral land laws; and  recognize the right of U.S. permittees, lessees, or grantees to enter the parcel to prospect for and mine deposits.  (Sec. 6) After the period for applications expires, but for only 60 days, the BLM shall offer for purchase the surface rights to the remaining identified federal land located north or south of the vegetation line of the South Bank. The purchase offer shall go first to federally recognized Indian tribes holding reservation or allotment land on June 5, 1906, that possess the right of first refusal, then to specified adjacent landowners located in Oklahoma or Texas for each next right of refusal.  The bill defines \"remaining identified federal lands\" as any parcel of identified federal lands:   not subject to appeal or further judicial review,  not determined by an Interior Administrative Law Judge or a federal court to be the property of an adjacent landowner, and  not patented or subject to a pending request for a patent.    Any such parcel that is not purchased shall be offered by BLM for disposal by a competitive sale for not less than fair market value.   Any such sale shall be subject to: (1) the condition that all minerals contained in the parcel are reserved to the United States and subject to sale or disposal under applicable leasing and mineral land laws; (2) the condition that permittees, lessees, or grantees have the right to enter the parcel to prospect for and mine deposits; and (3) valid existing state, tribal, and local rights.  (Sec. 7) The BLM may not treat a parcel of identified federal lands as federal land for purposes of a resource management plan if the treatment does not comply with this Act. ",

Authority is permanently extended for: (1) funding the DOD Acquisition Workforce Development Fund, and (2) expedited hiring for acquisition workforce positions. A dual-track career path is established that permits officers and enlisted personnel to gain experience in a primary career in combat arms and a secondary career in the acquisition field.   DOD is required to:   provide mandatory training for members of the armed forces and DOD employees responsible for specified procurement-related market research, and contract for an independent comprehensive study of strategic planning related to the defense acquisition workforce.     Each major defense acquisition program and each major system approved by a Milestone Decision Authority shall have an acquisition strategy, including a risk management and mitigation strategy, for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics shall be responsible.    The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 is amended to repeal the provision regarding prototyping requirements for major defense acquisition programs.  The Under Secretary shall: (1) complete an examination of the decision authority related to acquisition of services, and (2) develop guidance to improve capabilities and processes related to oversight and management of services contracts.  Defense business system requirements are revised. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 is amended to eliminate the pilot program designation of the mentor-protege program. The Small Business Act is amended to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to implement the plan to improve the quality of data reported on bundled or consolidated contracts in the federal procurement data system by the first day of FY2017. The Secretary of Defense shall direct the Defense Business Board to review DOD regulations and practices related to government access to and use of intellectual property rights of private sector firms. The Secretary of each military department shall expend specified amounts of the respective military department's extramural budget for small business innovative research (SBIR) for FY2018 and each subsequent fiscal year. The authorization of appropriations under the Ike Skeleton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 is extended through FY2020 for the defense research and development rapid innovation program.  The Director of Operational Test Evaluation shall consider the potential for increases in program cost estimates or delays in schedule estimates in the implementation of policies, procedures, and activities related to operational test and evaluation, and shall ensure that operational test and evaluation activities do not unnecessarily increase program costs or impede program schedules. The Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps shall review their current individual defense acquisitions authorities with respect to development of DOD requirements, acquisition processes, and associated budget practices. The SBA Administrator is added to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council. The Secretary of Defense shall:   contract for an independent study of factors leading to the filing of bid protests, and  designate an individual within DOD to make commercial item determinations for DOD procurement purposes.   A contracting officer may consider evidence provided by an offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the government for identical or similar commercial items in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference.  Thresholds are raised for: (1) simplified acquisition, (2) micro purchases, (3) special emergency procurement both inside and outside the United States, and (4) the small business reservation. The rounding method is revised for making inflation adjustments to acquisition-related dollar thresholds.

Requires the termination of an IRS employee for disproportionate scrutiny of an organization applying for tax-exempt status based on the ideology expressed in the name or purpose of the organization. Authorizes a court to issue a declaratory judgment with respect to the initial or continuing classification of a tax-exempt social welfare organization.
