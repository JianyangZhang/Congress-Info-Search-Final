Highlights:  This bill provides FY2018 appropriations for:    the civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;   the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project;   the Department of Energy (DOE); and   several independent agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   The bill decreases discretionary FY2018 Energy and Water Development funding below FY2017 levels.  Compared to FY2017 levels, the bill increases funding for the Army Corps of Engineers and decreases funding for both DOE and the Bureau of Reclamation.  Within the DOE budget, the bill does not fund the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy program and reduces funding for several other energy research programs. The bill funds DOE's science research at the FY2017 level and increases funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration.  The bill also includes provisions that affect policies in areas such as:   federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act),  the drawdown and sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the possession of firearms on Corps of Engineers lands, and  nuclear nonproliferation projects in Russia.

(Sec. 306) Authorizes DOE to draw down and sell refined petroleum product from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) upon a determination by the President in this fiscal year that:    a regional supply shortage of refined petroleum product of significant scope and duration exists,   a severe increase in the price of refined petroleum product will likely result from the shortage, and   a draw down and sale of refined petroleum product would assist directly and significantly in reducing the adverse impact of the shortage.   Specifies that the proceeds from the sale must be deposited into the SPR Petroleum Account and remain available for obligation without fiscal year limitation, consistent with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. (Sec. 307) Requires DOE to drawdown and sell up to $8.4 million of crude oil from the SPR during this fiscal year (in addition to sales authorized under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015).

Highlights:  This bill provides continuing appropriations for most federal agencies through the earlier of April 28, 2017, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.  It is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing CR expires on December 9, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted.

The bill funds most projects and activities at the rate established for FY2017 spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill also includes several exceptions, known as anomalies, which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.  The bill also includes additional emergency, disaster relief, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.  The bill extends several programs that are otherwise scheduled to expire, including health benefits for certain retired miners and their families.

Declares that the city will construct up to 20 apartment units on the conveyed parcel. Requires that the design and configuration of the units be determined by the city in consultation with the USDA and other interested parties, except that the units may not exceed two stories and must be located near or against the hillside to blend in with the terrain.  Makes the private land use regulations of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area inapplicable to the parcel, including with regard to the number and type of apartments units to be constructed on it.  Makes the USDA responsible for the removal of the barn located on the parcel, either before the conveyance of the parcel or at such later date as the city may request.  Permits the city to contract for the development and management of the apartment units constructed on the parcel so long as the city retains ownership of the parcel in perpetuity.  (Sec. 207) States that the issuance of a special use permit or the conveyance of land under this title shall be subject to any terms and conditions that the Department concerned determines to be appropriate.  Reserves a reversionary interest in the United States, for exercise at departmental discretion, if any parcel of land conveyed under this title ceases to be used for the public purpose for which it was conveyed.
