(Sec. 3) The bill provides for a 15 member Commission appointed by the President and congressional leaders with consideration given to individuals with expertise in economics, statistics, program evaluation, data security, confidentiality, or database management. (Sec. 4) The Commission must conduct a comprehensive study of the data inventory, data infrastructure, database security, and statistical protocols related to federal policymaking and the agencies responsible for maintaining that data to:  determine the optimal arrangement for which administrative data on federal programs and tax expenditures, survey data, and related statistical data series may be integrated and made available to facilitate program evaluation, continuous improvement, policy-relevant research, and cost-benefit analyses;  make recommendations on how data infrastructure, database security, and statistical protocols should be modified to best fulfill those objectives; and  make recommendations on how best to incorporate outcomes measurement, institutionalize randomized controlled trials, and rigorous impact analysis into program design.  The Commission shall consider whether a clearinghouse for program and survey data should be established and how to create such clearinghouse.  The Commission shall evaluate:  what administrative data and survey data are relevant for program evaluation and federal policy-making and should be included in a clearinghouse;  which survey data such administrative data may be linked to, in addition to linkages across administrative data series;  what are the legal and administrative barriers to including or linking these data series;  what data-sharing infrastructure should be used to facilitate data merging and access for research purposes;  how a clearinghouse could be self-funded;  which researchers, officials, and institutions should have access to data;  what limitations should be placed on the use of data;  how to protect information and ensure individual privacy and confidentiality;  how data and results of research can be used to inform program administrators and policymakers to improve program design; what incentives may facilitate interagency sharing of information to improve programmatic effectiveness and enhance data accuracy and comprehensiveness; and how individuals whose data are used should be notified of its usages.   The Commission shall, upon the affirmative vote of at least three-quarters of its members, submit to the President and Congress a detailed statement of its findings and conclusions, together with its recommendations for appropriate legislation or administrative actions. (Sec. 5) The following agencies shall advise and consult with the Commission on matters within their respective areas of responsibility:  the Bureau of the Census; the Internal Revenue Service; the Social Security Administration; the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Justice; the Office of Management and Budget; the Bureau of Economic Analysis; and  the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  (Sec. 6) The agencies identified as Principal Statistical Agencies in the report entitled \"Statistical Programs of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2015,\" published by the Office of Management and Budget, shall transfer up to $3 million to the Bureau of the Census, upon request, for carrying out the activities of the Commission. The Bureau of the Census shall provide administrative support to the Commission.  No additional funds may be authorized to carry out this Act.

Includes among such objectives:  more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access; the reduction or elimination of trade barriers and distortions that are directly related to trade and investment and that decrease market opportunities for U.S. exports or otherwise distort U.S. trade; stronger international trade and investment disciplines and procedures, including dispute settlement; enhanced U.S. competitiveness; protection of the environment; respect for worker and children rights consistent with International Labor Organization core labor standards; and equal access of small businesses to international markets.  Declares the principal trade negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to:  goods and services; agriculture; foreign investment; intellectual property; digital goods and services, as well as cross-border data flows; regulatory practices; state-owned and state-controlled enterprises; localization barriers to trade; labor and the environment; currency; the World Trade Organization (WTO) and multilateral trade agreements; trade institution transparency; anti-corruption; dispute settlement and enforcement; trade remedy laws; border taxes; textile negotiations; commercial partnerships, especially with Israel; and good governance, transparency, operation of legal regimes, and the rule of law of U.S. trading partners.  Directs the President, in order to maintain U.S. competitiveness in the global economy, to engage in specified capacity building activities with respect to foreign countries that seek to enter into trade agreements with the United States. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the President to enter into trade agreements with foreign countries for the reduction or elimination of tariff or nontariff barriers before July 1, 2018, or before July 1, 2021, if trade authorities procedures are extended to implementing bills (congressional approval) with respect to such agreements. Authorizes the President to proclaim necessary or appropriate modifications or continuation of any existing duty, continuation of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties to carry out any such agreement. (Sec. 4) Subjects trade agreements to congressional oversight and approval, consultations, and access to information requirements. Requires the convening each Congress of the House and the Senate Advisory Groups on Negotiations to consult with and advise the United States Trade Representative (USTR) regarding the formulation of specific objectives, negotiating strategies and positions, the development of the applicable trade agreement, and compliance and enforcement of the negotiated commitments under the trade agreement. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to establish within the Office of the USTR the position of Chief Transparency Officer to consult with Congress on transparency policy, coordinate transparency in trade negotiations, engage and assist the public, and advise the USTR on transparency policy. (Sec. 5) Specifies presidential notifications, consultations, reports, and other actions and their deadlines that must take place for any trade agreement to enter into force. Specifies requirements for negotiations regarding agriculture, the fishing industry, and textiles. (Sec. 6) Prescribes procedures for resolutions of disapproval in the House and the Senate before the President enters into any trade agreement. Declares that trade authorities procedures shall not apply to any implementing bill submitted with respect to a trade agreement entered into if both chambers of Congress agree by a certain deadline to a procedural disapproval resolution for lack of notice or consultations. (Sec. 7) Prescribes requirements for the treatment of trade agreements entered into under the auspices of the WTO or with the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries or the European Union which result from negotiations commenced before enactment of this Act. (Sec. 8) Declares that any provision of a trade agreement that is inconsistent with any U.S. laws shall be null and void.

                "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) TITLE I--EXTENSION OF AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act of 2015 (Sec. 103) This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to extend through FY2025 the duty-free treatment of the products of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under those Acts.  The extended period also applies to:   the preferential treatment of apparel articles wholly assembled, or components knit-to-shape and wholly assembled, in one or more beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries from yarns originating in the United States or one or more beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries or former beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, or both; and the third-country fabric program granting duty-free treatment of apparel articles wholly assembled, or knit-to-shape and wholly assembled, or both, in one or more lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, regardless of the country of origin of the fabric or the yarn used to make such articles.  (Sec. 104) This bill amends the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to revise rules of origin for duty-free treatment of articles of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. (Sec. 105) The President must not terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country unless, at least 60 days before termination, the President notifies Congress and the country of that intention. The President, instead of terminating the designation, may withdraw, suspend, or limit the duty-free treatment for any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if that would be more effective in promoting the country's compliance with certain requirements, including a market-based economy and the rule of law, the protection of human rights and internationally-recognized worker rights, elimination of trade barriers to the United States, and non-engagement in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests or support acts of international terrorism.  The President may not withdraw, suspend, or limit the duty-free treatment before notifying Congress and the country in question of that intention at least 60 days in advance.  The President shall:  publish annually in the Federal Register a notice of review and request for public comments on whether beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries are meeting the eligibility requirements for preferential treatment under AGOA and the Trade Act of 1974, and establish a process for interested persons to file a petition with the United States Trade Representative regarding the compliance of sub-Saharan African countries with such requirements.  The President may also, at any time, initiate an out-of-cycle review of whether a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country is making continual progress in meeting preferential treatment eligibility requirements.  (Sec. 106) It is the sense of Congress that beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries should develop strategies biennially for more effective utilization of AGOA trade benefits. It is the sense of Congress further that these biennial AGOA utilization strategies should:   review potential exports under AGOA and identify opportunities and obstacles to increased trade and investment and enhanced poverty reduction, set out a strategy to promote small business, eliminate obstacles to regional trade and promote greater utilization of AGOA trade benefits and establish a plan to fully implement the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization, and be published on the appropriate websites of each sub-Saharan African country and the USTR.   (Sec. 107) It is U.S. policy to continue to seek to deepen and expand trade and investment ties between sub-Saharan African and the United States through specified actions. (Sec. 108) The President shall report biennially to Congress, starting within one year after enactment of this Act, on trade and investment between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries and implementation of this Act. The USTR shall report every five years to Congress, starting within one year after enactment of this Act, on sub-Saharan African countries that have expressed an interest in entering into a free trade agreement with the United States.  TITLE II--EXTENSION OF GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (Sec. 201) This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend duty-free treatment under the GSP through December 31, 2017. (Sec. 202) The President may designate certain cotton articles as eligible for duty-free treatment only for least-developed beneficiary developing countries. (Sec. 203) The competitive need limitation and waiver requirements under the GSP shall apply to certain import-sensitive articles exported (directly or indirectly) from beneficiary developing countries to the United States during calendar 2014. TITLE III--EXTENSION OF PREFERENTIAL DUTY TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR HAITI   (Sec. 301) This bill amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to extend through December 19, 2025, the duty-free entry of apparel articles, including woven articles and certain knit articles, assembled in Haiti and imported from Haiti or the Dominican Republic to the United States. The special duty-free rules for Haiti shall now extend through September 30, 2025.  TITLE IV--OTHER PROVISIONS (Sec. 401) This bill amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1958 to extend customs user fees for certain customs services performed through July 7, 2025.  (Sec. 402) The required installment of corporate estimated tax payments for a corporation with assets of at least $1 billion which is otherwise due in the third quarter of 2020 shall be increased by 5.25%.",

Sets forth the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2015, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY2016-FY2024.  Title I: Recommended Levels and Amounts - (Sec. 101) Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts for FY2015-FY2024 with respect to: (1) federal revenues, (2) new budget authority, (3) budget outlays, (4) deficits (on-budget), (5) debt subject to limit, and (6) debt held by the public.  (Sec. 102) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority and outlays for specified major functional categories for FY2015-FY2024.  Title II: Recommended Long-Term Levels - (Sec. 201) Lists recommended revenue, spending, and deficit levels and amounts for FY2030, FY2035, and FY2040 as a percent of the federal gross domestic product (GDP) with respect to: (1) federal revenues, (2) budget outlays, (3) deficits, and (4) debt.  Title III: Reserve Funds - (Sec. 301) Authorizes a certain reserve fund to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (2010 health care laws).  (Sec. 302) Authorizes certain deficit-neutral reserve funds:  to reform the 2010 health care laws, to repeal all or part of the decreases in Medicare spending included in them, for the sustainable growth rate of the Medicare program, to reform the tax code, to implement a trade agreement, for revenue measures that would not increase the deficit for FY2015-FY2024, for rural counties and schools for transportation by maintaining the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund, and to reform policies and programs to reduce poverty and increase opportunity and upward mobility.  Title IV: Estimates of Direct Spending - (Sec. 401) Establishes means-tested direct spending: (1) at 6.8% for the average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period preceding FY2015, and (2) at 5.4% under current law for the estimated average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period beginning with FY2015.  Proposes the following reforms for means-tested directed spending:  assuming the conversion of the federal share of Medicaid spending into a flexible state allotment tailored to meet each state’s needs, indexed for inflation and population growth;  assuming the conversion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) into such a state allotment; and  increasing the allotment based on the Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan index and beneficiary growth.   Establishes at 5.7% for non-means-tested direct spending for such average rate of growth and at 5.4% under current law for such estimated average rate growth.  Proposes reforms for non-means-tested direct spending: (1) with respect to Medicare, by advancing specified policies to put seniors, not the federal government, in control of their health care decisions; and (2) by calling for federal employees, including Members of Congress and congressional staff, to make greater contributions toward their own retirement. Title V: Budget Enforcement - (Sec. 501) Prohibits House legislation that would require advance appropriations, except certain FY2016 programs, projects, activities, or accounts. (Sec. 503) Declares that, if a committee other than the Committee on Appropriations reports legislation that decreases direct spending (budget authority and outlays) for any fiscal year and also authorizes appropriations for the same purpose, upon the enactment of that measure, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may decrease the allocation to such committee and increase the allocation of discretionary spending to the Committee on Appropriations for FY2015 by the amount of the new budget authority and outlays provided for in legislation making appropriations for the same purpose. Authorizes the chair to adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate budgetary levels for veterans programs, Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT), or committee allocation to the Committee on Appropriations specified in the report of this budget resolution to conform with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) (as adjusted by the Budget Control Act of 2011). (Sec. 504) Makes it out of order in the House to consider legislation reported out of committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) if it has the net effect of increasing direct spending in excess of $5 billion for any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal-year periods beginning with FY2025. (Sec. 505) Requires the report or the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on this budget resolution to include in its allocation to the House Committee on Appropriations amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and of the Postal Service. Authorizes the chair to adjust allocations and aggregates for legislation reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that reforms the federal retirement system, but does not cause a net increase in the deficit for FY2015-FY2024. (Sec. 507) Requires any estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for a measure under the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) to also provide, as a supplement, and to the extent practicable, upon the request of the chair or ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the \"fair value\" of assets and liabilities affected by such measure. Requires, whenever the Director prepares an estimate of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out any bill or joint resolution and determines that such legislation has a cost related to a housing or residential mortgage program under the FCRA, the Director to also provide an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the \"fair value\" of assets and liabilities affected by the provisions of the measure that result in such cost. Authorizes the chair to use such estimate to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budgetary enforcement controls. (Sec. 508) Counts legislation that transfers funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund as new budget authority and outlays equal to the amount of the transfer in the fiscal year in which the transfer occurs. (Sec. 509) Provides a separate allocation in the House to the Committee on Appropriations for OCO/GWOT for FY2015. Title VI: Policy Statements - (Sec. 601) Declares the policy of this budget resolution on:  economic growth and job creation; tax reform; replacing the President's health care law; Medicare reform; Social Security; higher education and workforce development opportunity; deficit reduction through the cancellation of unobligated balances; responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars; deficit reduction through the reduction of unnecessary and wasteful spending; unauthorized spending; federal regulatory policy; trade; and  no budget, no pay.
