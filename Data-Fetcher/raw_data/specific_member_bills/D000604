Cybersecurity Act of 2015 TITLE I--CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (Sec. 103) This title requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Defense (DOD), and Justice (DOJ) to issue procedures that promote the sharing of: (1) classified cyber threat indicators and defensive measures in possession of the federal government with relevant federal entities and nonfederal entities that have security clearances; (2) declassified cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and information relating to cybersecurity threats or authorized uses of such information with relevant federal and nonfederal entities; (3) unclassified indicators with the public; (4) cybersecurity threat or authorized use information with entities under such threats; and (5) cybersecurity best practices with attention to the challenges faced by small businesses. A \"defensive measure\" is an action, device, procedure, signature, technique, or other measure applied to an information system or information that is stored on or processed by, or that is transiting, an information system that detects, prevents, or mitigates a known or suspected cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability. Defensive measures do not include measures that destroy, render unusable, provide unauthorized access to, or substantially harm an information system or information stored on, processed by, or transiting such information system not owned by: (1) the private entity operating the measure, or (2) another entity that is authorized to provide, and has provided, consent to that private entity for operation of such measure. The term: (1) \"nonfederal entity\" includes private entities, nonfederal government agencies, or state, tribal, or local governments; and (2) \"private entity\" includes state, tribal, or local governments performing electric, natural gas, water, or other utility services. Both terms exclude foreign powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Such procedures must incorporate sector-specific information sharing and analysis centers and include a process for timely notifications to: (1) recipients of threat indicators or defensive measures from federal entities when the federal government has shared indicators in error or in contravention of law, and (2) U.S. persons whose personal information has been shared by the federal government in violation of this title. The DNI must submit such procedures to Congress within 60 days after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 104) To detect, prevent, or mitigate cybersecurity threats or security vulnerabilities, private entities may monitor and operate defensive measures on: (1) their own information systems; and (2) with authorization and written consent, the information systems of other private or government entities.  Nonfederal entities may share and receive indicators and defensive measures with other entities or the federal government for a cybersecurity purpose. Recipients must comply with lawful restrictions that sharing entities place on the sharing or use of shared indicators or defensive measures. The federal government and entities monitoring, operating, or sharing indicators or defensive measures must: (1) utilize security controls to protect against unauthorized access or acquisitions; and (2) remove information not directly related to a cybersecurity threat that is known to be personal information of, or information that identifies, a specific individual.  This title exempts from antitrust laws private entities that, for cybersecurity purposes, exchange or provide: (1) cyber threat indicators or defensive measures; or (2) assistance relating to the prevention, investigation, or mitigation of cybersecurity threats. The exemption is inapplicable to price-fixing, allocating a market between competitors, monopolizing or attempting to monopolize a market, boycotting, or exchanges of price or cost information, customer lists, or information regarding future competitive planning. (Sec. 105) DOJ and DHS must issue procedures relating to the receipt of indicators and defensive measures by the federal government. The procedures must include automated real-time sharing procedures, an audit capability, and appropriate sanctions for federal officers, employees, or agents who conduct unauthorized activities.  DOJ and DHS must also develop, and make publicly available, guidelines to assist entities in sharing indicators with the federal government, including guidance for identifying cyber threat indicators that would be unlikely to include personal information not directly related to a threat.  DOJ and DHS must issue, and review at least every two years, privacy and civil liberties guidelines to limit receipt, retention, use, and dissemination of personal or identifying information. The guidelines must include steps to make dissemination of cyber threat indicators consistent with the protection of classified and other sensitive national security information. DHS must develop a process within DHS for the federal government to: (1) accept cyber threat indicators and defensive measures from any nonfederal entity in real time, and (2) ensure that DOD, DHS, DOJ, the DNI, and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and the Treasury receive the shared indicators and defensive measures in an automated manner through that real-time process. The DHS capability must be the process by which the federal government receives indicators and defensive measures under this title that are shared by a nonfederal entity with the federal government through electronic mail or media, an interactive Internet website form, or a real-time, automated process between information systems, except: (1) communications between a federal entity and a nonfederal entity regarding a previously shared cyber threat indicator to describe the relevant cybersecurity threat or develop a defensive measure based on such indicator, and (2) a regulated nonfederal entity's communications with its federal regulatory authority regarding a cybersecurity threat. DHS's process is prohibited from limiting lawful disclosures to: (1) report known or suspected criminal activity, including indicators or defensive measures shared with a federal entity in furtherance of opening a federal law enforcement investigation; (2) participate in a federal investigation voluntarily or upon being legally compelled; or (3) provide indicators or defensive measures as part of a statutory or authorized contractual requirement. Within 90 days after enactment of this Act, DHS must submit to Congress a certification as to whether the DHS sharing capability is fully operational. After DHS submits such a certification, the President may designate DOJ, the DNI, Commerce, Energy, or Treasury to develop a sharing capability in addition to the DHS capability. Before making such a designation, the President must submit a certification to Congress regarding its necessity. DHS must ensure that there is public notice of, and access to, the DHS sharing procedures. Cyber threat indicators and defensive measures shared with the federal government and threat indicators shared with state, tribal, or local governments are: (1) deemed voluntarily shared information, and (2) exempt from disclosure and withheld from the public under any laws of such jurisdictions requiring disclosure of information or records. Consistent with otherwise applicable federal law, indicators and defensive measures provided to the government under this title may be disclosed to, retained by, and used by any federal agency or federal government agent solely for, or may be used by state, tribal, or local governments for:   protecting an information system or information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an information system from a cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability;  identifying a cybersecurity threat, including the source, or a security vulnerability;  responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, a specific threat of death, serious bodily harm, or serious economic harm, including a terrorist act or a use of a weapon of mass destruction;  responding to, investigating, prosecuting, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, a serious threat to a minor, including sexual exploitation and threats to physical safety; or  preventing, investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting offenses relating to fraud and identity theft, espionage and censorship, trade secrets, or offenses arising out of a specific threat of death, serious bodily harm, or serious economic harm.  Government agencies may not use shared indicators or defensive measures to regulate the lawful activities of a nonfederal entity or activities taken by a nonfederal entity pursuant to mandatory standards. (Sec. 106) Liability protections are provided to private entities acting in accordance with this title that: (1) monitor information systems; or (2) share or receive indicators or defensive measures, provided that the manner in which an entity shares such indicators or measures with the federal government is consistent with specified procedures and exceptions set forth under the DHS sharing process.  Nothing in this title may be construed to create a duty to share information or a duty to warn or act based on receipt of such information.  (Sec. 107) The appropriate federal entities must report to Congress concerning the implementation of this title. The report must include:   an evaluation of the effectiveness of real-time information sharing,  an assessment of whether cyber threat indicators or defensive measures have been properly classified,  an accounting of the number of security clearances authorized by the federal government to share indicators or defensive measures with the private sector, and  the number of indicators or measures received through the DHS sharing process and a list of federal entity recipients.   Inspectors general of appropriate federal entities must report to Congress at least every two years regarding the executive branch's actions to carry out this title. The reports must include: (1) a review of the federal government's actions based on shared indicators or defensive measures, including an indication of whether sharing occurred in a timely manner and a review of the appropriateness of subsequent uses and disseminations; (2) an assessment of any information not directly related to a cybersecurity threat that is personal information of a specific individual or information identifying a specific individual and that was shared by a nonfederal government entity with the federal government, or that was shared within the federal government; and (3) the number of times shared information was used by a federal entity to prosecute an offense for which the government is authorized to disclose, retain, and use information.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), within three years after enactment of this Act, must report on the federal government's actions to remove personal information from cyber threat indicators or defensive measures. (Sec. 108) Nothing in this title shall be construed to permit a federal entity to require a nonfederal entity to provide information to a federal entity or another nonfederal entity. (Sec. 109) The DNI must report to Congress regarding cybersecurity threats, including cyber attacks, theft, and data breaches. The report must include: (1) an assessment of current U.S. intelligence sharing and cooperation relationships with other countries regarding cybersecurity threats to the U.S. national security interests, economy, and intellectual property; (2) a list of countries and nonstate actors that are primary threats; (3) a description of the U.S. government's response and prevention capabilities; and (4) an assessment of additional technologies that would enhance U.S. capabilities, including private sector technologies that could be rapidly fielded to assist the intelligence community. (Sec. 110) DOD may authorize the sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures pursuant to this title, notwithstanding military law restrictions on the dissemination of information. (Sec. 111) The effective period of this title ends on September 30, 2025, but it shall continue in effect for actions authorized or information obtained pursuant to this title before it ceases to have effect. TITLE II--NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY ADVANCEMENT Subtitle A--National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 (Sec. 203) The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to redefine, for purposes of the national cybersecurity and communications integration center (NCCIC): (1) \"cybersecurity risk\" to exclude actions that solely involve a violation of a consumer term of service or a consumer licensing agreement; and (2) \"incident\" to include an occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, an information system, thereby replacing a standard that includes occurrences that constitute a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

The composition of the NCCIC is also expanded to include a collaborator with state and local governments.  The NCCIC must: (1) designate an agency contact for nonfederal entities; (2) safeguard information from unauthorized disclosure; and (3) work with DHS's privacy officer to ensure that the NCCIC follows privacy, civil liberty, and information disclosure procedures required for DHS's sharing capability.  DHS must report annually on its progress in developing capabilities that support automated sharing mechanisms. The NCCIC may enter a voluntary information sharing relationship with any consenting nonfederal entity, but a nonfederal entity is not required to enter such a relationship with the NCCIC or another entity. The NCCIC may terminate, and DHS may decline to enter, a voluntary information sharing relationship with a nonfederal entity at the sole and unreviewable discretion of the DHS Secretary, acting through the DHS Under Secretary responsible for critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity, for any reason.  DHS must develop policies for the NCCIC's direct reporting to the DHS Secretary regarding significant cybersecurity risks and incidents.  DHS must report periodically on its efforts to bolster cybersecurity collaboration with relevant international partners.  DHS must: (1) disseminate to the public information about how to voluntarily share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with the NCCIC, and (2) enhance outreach to critical infrastructure owners and operators for purposes of such sharing.  (Sec. 204) The purpose of information sharing and analysis organizations is expanded to include activities to gather, analyze, and disseminate information about cybersecurity risks and incidents.  (Sec. 205) DHS must update, maintain, and exercise the Cyber Incident Annex to DHS's National Response Framework. (Sec. 206) DHS must report to Congress regarding the feasibility of creating an environment for the reduction in cybersecurity risks in DHS data centers, including by increasing compartmentalization between systems and providing a mix of security controls between compartments. (Sec. 207) The GAO must submit, within two years after enactment of this Act, a report that includes an assessment of DHS's implementation of this title and findings regarding increases in information sharing at the NCCIC.  (Sec. 208) DHS must provide information to Congress regarding the feasibility of producing a risk-informed plan to address the risk of multiple simultaneous cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure, including incidents that may have a cascading effect on other critical infrastructure.  (Sec. 209) DHS must report to Congress with recommendations to mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities for the 10 U.S. ports at greatest risk of a cybersecurity incident. (Sec. 210) Nothing in this subtitle may be construed to grant DHS any authority to promulgate regulations or set standards relating to the cybersecurity of nonfederal entities, not including state, local, and tribal governments, that was not in effect before the enactment of this Act.  (Sec. 211) The reporting requirements in this subtitle terminate seven years after enactment of this Act.  Subtitle B--Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 (Sec. 223) This subtitle amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require DHS, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to implement an intrusion assessment plan to proactively detect, identify, and remove intruders in federal agency information systems on a routine basis.  DHS must deploy, operate, and maintain, for use by other agencies, capabilities to: (1) detect cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting or traveling to or from an agency information system, and (2) prevent or modify such traffic to remove cybersecurity risks. The DHS Secretary may access, and agency heads may disclose to the Secretary, information transiting agency systems, regardless of the location from which the information is accessed, notwithstanding any laws that would otherwise restrict or prevent such disclosures.  Agencies must utilize such capabilities and adopt subsequent improvements.  DHS must establish a pilot through which it may test and deploy advanced technologies to improve detection and prevention.  DHS must also ensure that: (1) the activities are reasonably necessary to protect agency information and systems from a cybersecurity risk, (2) information accessed by DHS will be retained no longer than reasonably necessary for such purposes, and (3) notice is provided to users of agency information systems concerning access to their communications. This subtitle provides liability protections to private entities authorized to assist the Secretary with such capabilities. It prohibits the liability protections from being construed to authorize an Internet service provider to break a user agreement with customers without their consent. DHS's privacy officer, in consultation with DOJ, must review the intrusion detection and prevention system for consistency with privacy laws, including those governing acquisition, interception, retention, use, and disclosure of communications. The authority for such capabilities expires seven years after enactment of this Act.  DOD, national security systems, and the intelligence community are excluded from procedures of this subtitle. (Sec. 224) DHS must include advanced network security tools in its efforts to continuously diagnose and mitigate cybersecurity risks to improve visibility of network activity to detect and mitigate intrusions and anomalous activity. The OMB must implement a plan to ensure that agencies utilize such advanced tools.  DHS must collaborate with the OMB to update government information security metrics to include measures of intrusion and incident detection and response times. The OMB must display additional agency metrics on federal government performance websites.  Upon an agency's request, DHS is authorized to operate and maintain technology that is deployed to agencies to diagnose and mitigate against cyber threats and vulnerabilities.  (Sec. 225) DHS must issue binding operational directives to assist the OMB in ensuring timely agency adoption of and compliance with standards for securing agency information systems. Agencies must: (1) encrypt sensitive and mission critical data or otherwise render such data indecipherable to unauthorized users; (2) implement single sign-on trusted identity platforms for public websites; and (3) implement identity management, including multifactor authentication standards, for remote access to agency systems and user accounts with elevated privileges. Agency information systems are exempted from such cybersecurity requirements if the agency certifies to the OMB and Congress that the agency has taken all steps necessary to secure the agency's systems and that the requirements would be excessively burdensome and unnecessary. (Sec. 226) The GAO, within three years after enactment of this Act, must report on the effectiveness of the federal government's approach to securing agency information systems. DHS must report annually to Congress on the implementation status of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. The Federal Chief Information Officer must submit to Congress a report assessing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, including their costs and benefits and the capabilities of agencies to protect threat indicators and defensive measures if they were shared through unclassified mechanisms for use in commercial technologies and tools. The OMB must submit to Congress: (1) an annual analysis of agency application of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities; (2) updated intrusion assessment plans; and (3) annual updates on implementation, assessment findings, agency compliance, utilization of advanced security tools, and security metrics. (Sec. 227) When authority expires for DHS's federal intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, the reporting requirements concerning such capabilities shall also expire.  (Sec. 228) The DNI and the OMB must submit to Congress an assessment of: (1) the risks that would result from the breach of unclassified information systems that provide access to information that may enable an adversary to derive information that would otherwise be considered classified, and (2) the cost and impact on the mission carried out by each agency if such systems were subsequently designated as national security systems. (Sec. 229) The DHS Secretary may issue an emergency directive to an agency to take any lawful action with respect to the operation of the agency's information system in response to a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or incident that represents a substantial threat to information security. DHS must report annually to Congress regarding the specific actions taken pursuant to such directive. The Secretary may also authorize the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to ensure the security of agency information systems if the Secretary: (1) determines that there is an imminent threat to such systems, that operational or emergency directives are unlikely to be timely, and that the risk outweighs any adverse consequences; (2) provides prior notice to the OMB and the chief information officers of the affected agencies and notice to Congress within seven days of taking an action; and (3) authorizes the use of protective capabilities under procedures established in coordination with the OMB. The Secretary may direct or authorize such lawful action or the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities only: (1) to protect agency information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction; or (2) to require the remediation of, or to protect against, identified information security risks for information collected or maintained by or on behalf of an agency or that portion of an information system used or operated by an agency or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of an agency. The OMB and DHS must report to Congress annually regarding specific actions they have taken to enforce agency compliance and accountability. TITLE III--FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE ASSESSMENT Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 (Sec. 303) This title requires federal agencies to: (1) identify all personnel positions that require the performance of cybersecurity or other cyber-related functions, and (2) assign a corresponding employment code to such positions using a coding structure developed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education. To implement the coding structure: (1) the OPM must coordinate with DHS, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the DNI to establish procedures to identify such federal civilian positions, and (2) DOD must establish procedures to identify such federal noncivilian positions. Federal agencies must submit to Congress a report identifying: (1) the percentage of personnel with such job functions who currently hold industry-recognized certifications, (2) the preparedness of other civilian and noncivilian cyber personnel without existing credentials to take certification exams, and (3) a strategy for mitigating any identified gaps with training and certification for existing personnel.  The agencies must establish procedures to identify all encumbered and vacant positions with such functions and assign the appropriate employment code to each position.  (Sec. 304) Annually through 2022, the agencies must submit a report to the OPM that identifies cyber-related roles designated as critical needs in the agency's workforce. The OPM must provide agencies with guidance for identifying work roles with acute and emerging skill shortages.  The OPM, within two years after enactment of this Act, must identify critical needs for the cyber workforce across all federal agencies and report to Congress regarding the implementation of this Act.  (Sec. 305) The GAO must report on the status of the implementation of this title within three years after enactment of this Act. TITLE IV--OTHER CYBER MATTERS (Sec. 401) DHS must report to Congress on threats relating to the security of the mobile devices of the federal government, including a plan for accelerated adoption of secure mobile device technology by DHS. (Sec. 402) The Department of State shall produce a comprehensive strategy relating to U.S. international cyberspace policy. The strategy must include:   a review of activities undertaken to support the goal of the President's International Strategy for Cyberspace;  a plan to guide the diplomacy of the State Department to obtain agreements on the norms of responsible international behavior in cyberspace;  a review of alternative concepts with regard to international norms in cyberspace offered by other foreign countries, including China, Russia, Brazil, and India;  a description of cyberspace threats to U.S. national security from foreign countries, state-sponsored actors, and private actors to federal and private sector infrastructure, U.S. intellectual property, and U.S. citizens;  a review of deterrent policy tools available to the President; and  a review of resources required by the State Department, including the Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, to build international cyber behavior norms.   The State Department must brief congressional committees on such issues and make the strategy available to the public.  (Sec. 403) The State Department must consult with countries in which international cyber criminals are physically present, and from which extradition is unlikely, to determine what actions those governments have taken to prosecute and prevent cyber or intellectual property crimes against U.S. interests or citizens.  The State Department must also report annually to Congress regarding: (1) the number of such criminals located in other countries, including an indication of countries from which extradition is unlikely; (2) its discussions with officials of other countries; and (3) each international cyber criminal extradited to the United States. (Sec. 404) The NCCIC must: (1) establish a process for statewide interoperability coordinators to report cybersecurity risks or incidents involving information systems or networks used by emergency response providers within their states, and (2) develop security and resilience recommendations for such networks. NIST must support, and report to Congress regarding, the development of methods for reducing cybersecurity risks to such emergency response providers. (Sec. 405) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must report to Congress regarding the preparedness of HHS and health care industry stakeholders in responding to cybersecurity threats. The report must identify the HHS official responsible for coordinating HHS cyber threat efforts and include plans on how HHS divisions will communicate with each other regarding such threats. HHS must convene a one-year task force of health care industry stakeholders, cybersecurity experts, and federal agencies to establish a plan for implementing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (title I of this division) so that the federal government and health care industry stakeholders may, in real time, share actionable cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. The task force must report to Congress regarding the plan and recommendations for securing private entities against cyber attacks and protecting networked medical devices and other software or systems that connect to an electronic health record. The task force must also provide HHS with cybersecurity preparedness information to disseminate to the health care industry.  HHS must collaborate with DHS, health care industry stakeholders, NIST, and other entities to establish a common set of volunt ary, consensus-based, and industry-led guidelines to serve as a resource for cost-effectively reducing cybersecurity risks for health care organizations.  (Sec. 406) Inspectors general of agencies operating national security systems or federal computer systems that provide access to personally identifiable information must report to Congress regarding their agencies': (1) logical access controls for granting or denying requests to obtain and use information and processing services; (2) use of multi-factor authentication that requires at least two of authentication factors (such as something that is known to the user, an access device provided to the user, or a unique biometric characteristic of the user) to gain access to information; (3) procedures to detect exfiltration and inventory software and licenses; and (4) policies to ensure that contractors and other entities providing services to the agency implement appropriate information security management practices.  (Sec. 407) This section amends the federal criminal code to extend extraterritorially the application of penalties for fraud offenses involving an access device issued, owned, managed, or controlled by a financial institution, account issuer, credit card system member, or other entity organized under the laws of the United States or any U.S. state or territory. (An access device is any card, code, electronic serial number, telecommunications service, or other means of account access that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds or to obtain money, goods, or services.) It removes a condition under current law that subjects a person to such penalties only if the underlying articles, property, or proceeds are held within or have transferred through U.S. jurisdiction. DIVISION O--OTHER MATTERS TITLE I--OIL EXPORTS, SAFETY VALVE, AND MARITIME SECURITY (Sec. 101) The division amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) to repeal the authority of the President to impose export restrictions upon coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstocks, and supplies of related materials or equipment. The division prohibits federal officials from either imposing or enforcing any restriction upon crude oil exports. The division does retain the President's authority under specified laws, however, to impose sanctions upon a foreign person or foreign government, including one designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, as well as the authority to prohibit or restrict U.S. persons from conducting transactions with a sanctioned person or government. The President may also impose licensing restrictions upon U.S.crude oil exports for a maximum one year period, if:   the President declares a national emergency and formally notices the declaration in the Federal Register;   the restrictions apply within the context of sanctions or trade restrictions imposed for reasons of national security by the Executive authority of the President or by Congress; or   the Secretary of Commerce reports to the President that  the export of crude oil has caused sustained material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly above world market levels directly attributable to the export of crude oil produced in the United States, and those shortages or increases have either caused or are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment effects in the U.S.    Restrictions imposed under this Act may be renewed for additional periods of not more than one year each. The Department of Transportation shall make increased payments for FY2017-FY2021 to the contractor for an operating agreement for each vessel covered by the agreement. The division increases the authorization of appropriations for such payments for each of FY2017-FY2021. TITLE II--TERRORIST TRAVEL PREVENTION AND VISA WAIVER PROGRAM REFORM Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 (Sec. 202) This division amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the visa waiver program to require that an alien, when applying for program admission, possess a valid unexpired passport that:   is machine-readable, tamper-resistant, incorporates document authentication identifiers, and otherwise satisfies the internationally accepted standard for machine readability; and  beginning on April 1, 2016, is an electronic passport that is fraud-resistant, contains relevant biographic and biometric information, and satisfies internationally accepted standards for electronic passports.   A program country must certify that:   it issues passports that satisfy the internationally accepted standard for machine readability, and as of April 1, 2016, passports that satisfy internationally accepted standards for electronic passports; and  by October 1, 2016, except for travel between countries within the Schengen Zone (26 European countries that have abolished passport and any other border control at their common borders), it has in place mechanisms to validate such passports at each key port of entry.  (Sec. 203) An alien shall be ineligible for program participation who:  has been present, at any time on or after March 1, 2011, in Iraq or Syria, in a country designated as one that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, or in any other country or area of concern designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and regardless of whether the alien is a national of a program country, is not a national of Iraq or Syria, a country designated as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, or any other country or area of concern.   Such prohibitions shall not apply to an alien who was present in such a country to perform military or official government service for a program country.  DHS may waive such prohibitions if in U.S. law enforcement or national security interests, and shall report annually to Congress on each waiver made in the previous year.  DHS shall determine and review annually whether such prohibitions shall apply to any country or area, considering whether:   the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that he or she is a credible U.S. security threat,  a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area, and  the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists.   (Sec. 204) A program country shall:   report the loss or theft of one of its national's passports to the United States within 24 hours; and  except in the case of a country without an international airport, and except for travel between countries within the Schengen Zone, certify to DHS that it is screening each entering or departing non-citizen or non-national for unlawful activity by using Interpol databases and notices, or other means designated by DHS.  If DHS and the State Department jointly determine that a program country is not sharing information or conducting required screening, DHS shall terminate the country's program status, subject to specified conditions for reinstatement. (Sec. 205) Certain reporting requirements are amended. (Sec. 206) DHS shall evaluate program countries annually and identify and suspend from program participation any country whose nationals present a high U.S. security risk.  In suspending a country DHS shall consider:   the number of nationals determined ineligible for U.S. travel during the previous year,  the number of nationals identified in U.S. government databases related to the identities of known or suspected terrorists during the previous year,  the estimated number of nationals who have traveled to Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011, to engage in terrorism,  the country's capacity to combat passport fraud,  the level of cooperation with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, and  the adequacy of the country's border and immigration controls.  DHS shall give Congress an annual evaluation and threat assessment of each country that presents a high U.S. security risk. (Sec. 207) DHS shall:   research opportunities to incorporate anti-fraud/deception technology into the electronic system for travel authorization; and  collect from an applicant information on any additional or previous countries of citizenship, and consider such information when making admissions determinations.   DHS shall report annually to Congress on: (1) the number of individuals denied travel eligibility under the program or whose travel eligibility was revoked during the previous year, and (2) the number of such individuals who were determined to represent a U.S. security threat. DHS shall report to Congress on steps to strengthen the electronic system for travel authorization. (Sec. 208) DHS shall provide assistance in a risk-based manner to non-program countries to assist them in:   submitting theft or loss of passport information to Interpol; and  issuing and validating at ports of entry electronic passports that are fraud-resistant, contain relevant biographic and biometric information, and otherwise satisfy internationally accepted standards for electronic passports.   (Sec. 209) The electronic travel authorization system is renamed the electronic system for travel authorization. (Sec. 210) It is the sense of Congress that:   the International Civil Aviation Organization should establish electronic passport standards and obligate member countries to utilize them as soon as possible, and  such passports should be a combined paper and electronic passport that contains biographic and biometric information that can be used to authenticate identity through an embedded chip.
