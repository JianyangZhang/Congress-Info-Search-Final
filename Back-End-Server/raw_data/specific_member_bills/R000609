DHS shall develop: (1) an initial five-year regional real property strategy, which shall be geographically organized; (2) a subsequent five-year real property strategy; and (3) a department-wide policy implementing such strategies.  The initial five-year strategy shall:  identify opportunities to consolidate real property, optimize the usage of federal assets, and decrease the number of commercial leases and square footage within DHS's real property portfolio;  provide alternate housing and consolidation plans to increase efficiency through joint use of DHS spaces while decreasing the reliance on and cost of leased space;  concentrate on geographical areas with a significant DHS presence;  examine the establishment of central DHS locations in each such geographical region and the co-location of DHS components based on their mission sets and responsibilities;  identify opportunities to reduce overhead costs through co-location or consolidation of real property interests or mission support activities;  manage the current Department Workspace Standard for Office Space in accordance with the DHS office workspace design process to develop the most efficient and effective spaces within the workspace standard net usable square foot ranges for all leases for office space entered into after enactment of this bill;  define, based on square footage, what constitutes a major real property acquisition; and  prioritize actions to be taken to improve the operations and management of DHS's real property inventory, based on life-cycle cost estimations.  The second five-year strategy shall contain related information, including: (1) the impact of such implementation on departmental operations and costs; and (2) the degree to which DHS established central DHS locations and co-located DHS components pursuant to the results of the required examination.  The implementation policies shall require components: (1) to certify to DHS that such components have complied with specified requirements before making any major real property decision or recommendation; and (2) acting through regional property managers, to report annually to DHS on underutilized space and identify space that may be made available for use by other components or federal agencies.  DHS may grant an exception to the workspace standard usable square foot ranges for specific office locations at which a reduction or elimination of otherwise underutilized space would negatively impact a component's ability to execute its mission based on readiness performance measures or would increase the cost of such space. Each component shall identify a senior career employee to serve as the property manager for each geographic region. Each such manager shall: (1) serve as a single point of contact for DHS headquarters and other DHS components for real property matters, (2) provide data and any other support necessary for the DHS Regional Mission Support Coordinator strategic asset and portfolio planning and execution, and (3) provide to DHS annually data on each component's real property holdings. DHS shall: (1) monitor components' adherence to the regional real property strategies and implementation policies; (2) annually review the data submitted to ensure all underutilized space is properly identified; (3) review and, if appropriate, approve component certifications before such components may make any major real property decision; and (4) annually provide information to Congress and to the Inspector General of DHS on its real property portfolio. The Inspector General shall review the information submitted and issue findings regarding the effectiveness of the implementation of the DHS-wide policy and oversight efforts of the management of real property facilities, personal property, mobile assets, requirement and DHS's other material resources.

Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the program manager of a major acquisition program (a Department of Homeland Security [DHS] acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300 million over its life cycle cost) to notify the program's Component Acquisition Executive (CAE) (the senior acquisition official within a DHS component who is designated to lead a process and staff to provide acquisition and program management oversight, policy, and guidance to ensure that statutory, regulatory, and higher level policy requirements are fulfilled), the head of the component concerned, the Executive Director of the Program Accountability and Risk Management division, the Under Secretary for Management, and the Deputy Secretary of DHS within 30 days after any breach in such program is identified. If such a breach results in a cost overrun greater than 15%, a schedule delay greater than 180 days, or a failure to meet any of the performance thresholds from the cost, schedule, or performance parameters specified in the most recently approved acquisition program baseline for such program, the CAE must notify the DHS Secretary and Inspector General within five business days after such other officials are notified of the breach. If such a breach occurs, the program manager shall submit to the component head, the Executive Director, and the Under Secretary in writing a remediation plan and root cause analysis relating to such breach and program. The remediation plan shall:   explain the circumstances of the breach;   provide prior cost estimating information;   include a root cause analysis that determines the underlying causes of shortcomings in cost, schedule, or performance of the program; propose corrective action to address such shortcomings;   explain the rationale for a proposed corrective action; and   in coordination with the CAE, discuss all options considered, including the estimated impact on cost, schedule, or performance of such program if no changes are made to current requirements, the estimated cost of such program if requirements are modified, and the extent to which funding from other programs will need to be reduced to cover the cost growth of such program.   The Under Secretary for Management shall review the remediation plan and may approve it or provide an alternative proposed corrective action within 30 days of its submission. The Under Secretary shall notify the congressional homeland security committees of such a breach. If a likely cost overrun is greater than 20% or a likely delay is greater than 12 months from the costs and schedule specified in the acquisition program baseline, the Under Secretary for Management shall include in such notification a written certification that:   such program is essential to the accomplishment of DHS's mission;   there are no alternatives to the capability or asset provided by such program that will provide equal or greater capability in both a more cost-effective and timely manner;   the new acquisition schedule and estimates for total acquisition cost are reasonable; and   the management structure for such program is adequate to manage and control cost, schedule, and performance.
