The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shall enter interagency agreements providing for cooperation and collaboration in the development of space weather spacecraft, instruments, and technologies and in the transition of research to operations. NASA shall: (1) maintain operations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO) for as long as the satellite continues to deliver quality observations; and (2) prioritize the reception of LASCO data. NOAA shall: (1) secure reliable secondary capability for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery; and (2) develop requirements and a plan for follow-on space-based observations for operational purposes.  The National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force, and the Navy shall each: (1)maintain and improve ground-based observations of the Sun, and (2) provide space weather data by means of ground-based facilities.  NOAA, the Air Force, and the Navy shall conduct a survey to prioritize the needs of space weather forecast users.  The NSF, NASA, and the Department of Defense (DOD) shall continue to carry out basic research activities on heliophysics, geospace science, and space weather and support merit-based proposals for research, modeling, and monitoring of space weather and its impacts. The NSF and NOAA shall support basic research activities in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences that will lead to improving national preparedness and encouraging mitigation and protection measures before a space weather event.   The NSF, NOAA, and NASA shall pursue multidisciplinary research in subjects that further our understanding of solar physics, space physics, and space weather.  NASA shall seek to implement missions meeting science objectives identified in National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Solar and Space Physics Decadal surveys.  NASA, the NSF, NOAA, the Air Force, and the Navy shall: (1) develop a mechanism to transition NASA, NSF, Air Force, and Navy research findings, research needs, models, and capabilities to NOAA and DOD space weather operational forecasting centers; and (2) enhance coordination between research modeling centers and forecasting centers.  NASA and the NSF shall: (1) make space weather related data obtained for scientific research available to space weather forecasters and operations centers, and (2) support model development and applications to space weather forecasting.  NOAA shall arrange with the NAS to establish a Space Weather Government-Industry-University Roundtable to facilitate communication and knowledge transfer among government participants in the Space Weather Interagency Group, industry, and academia to facilitate advances in space weather prediction and forecasting, help enable the two-way coordination of research and operations, and improve preparedness for potential space weather events.   The space weather interagency working group shall develop benchmarks for measuring solar disturbances.   NOAA shall inform the Department of Homeland Security about space weather hazards to protect national critical infrastructure from space weather events.  The National Security Council shall develop mechanisms to protect national security assets from space weather threats.   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall: (1) assess the safety implications and vulnerability of the nation's airspace system by space weather events, and (2) develop methods to increase the interaction between the aviation community and the space weather research and service provider community.

A TBO is any bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, bank, or savings association that individually (and when including its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates) meets the following criteria:  has zero trading assets and zero trading liabilities, does not engage in swaps or security-based swaps other than those referencing interest rates or foreign exchange swaps, and   has a total gross notional exposure of swaps and security-based swaps of not more than $3 billion.  \"Simple leverage ratio\" means:  total equity less goodwill and deferred tax assets, divided by   total assets less goodwill and deferred tax assets, as measured by generally accepted accounting principles.   A TBO meeting this minimum simple leverage ratio may notify the federal banking agencies to maintain it as the sole measure of its capital adequacy. The risk-based capital requirement shall not apply to it. If the TBO fails to maintain the minimum simple leverage ratio, it shall remain exempt from the risk-based capital requirement for an 18-month grace period. The bill grants a TBO with a simple leverage ratio of 8% or more a phase-in period of 18 months after enactment of this bill within which to elect to meet the minimum simple leverage ratio as its sole measure of capital adequacy.   The federal banking agencies, with respect to reports of condition, shall permit a reduced reporting requirement for a TBO electing to maintain a simple leverage ratio as its sole measure of capital adequacy.  The 18-month on-site examination cycle shall apply to TBOs (and, as under current law, to insured depository institutions whose assets total less than $1 billion) if the appropriate federal banking agency believes this is consistent with the TBO's safety and soundness.  The bill repeals the authority of federal banking agencies, at their discretion, to increase the maximum asset amount of insured depository institutions for certain purposes.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is amended to exempt TBOs from mandatory annual stress tests.",
