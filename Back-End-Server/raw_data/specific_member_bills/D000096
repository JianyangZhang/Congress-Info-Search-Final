A regional partnership shall include as mandatory partners the state agencies responsible for administering:   the state plans for child and family services and for foster care and adoption assistance, and the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant under the Public Health Service Act.   A partnership proposing to serve children in out-of-home placements shall have as a mandatory partner the Juvenile Court or Administrative Office of the Court that is most appropriate to oversee the administration of court programs in the region to address the population of families who come to court attention because of child abuse or neglect.  The bill sets the amount of such grants in amounts between $250,000 (currently $500,000) and $1 million per grant per fiscal year. Grants shall be disbursed in two phases: (1) a planning phase (not to exceed two years); and (2) an implementation phase. The total disbursement to a grantee for the planning phase may not exceed $250,000, and may not exceed the total anticipated funding for the implementation phase. No payment shall be made for a fiscal year until the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines that the eligible partnership has made sufficient progress in meeting the goals of the grant, and that the members of the eligible partnership are coordinating to a reasonable degree with the other partnership members. HHS shall:  review indicators that are used to assess periodically the performance of the grant recipients; and establish a set of core indicators related to child safety, parental recovery, parenting capacity, and family well-being.   Grant recipients must report semiannually to HHS on services provided and activities carried out and on progress made in achieving the goals of the program. (Sec. 3) The amendments made by this bill are effective on October 1, 2017. The bill allows states and Indian tribes additional time for compliance with requirements imposed by this bill. ",
