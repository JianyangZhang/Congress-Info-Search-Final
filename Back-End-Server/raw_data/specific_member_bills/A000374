NIST must also: (1) support development of information security training and certification for agency heads, (2) address agency-identified information security challenges and knowledge gaps, (3) assess information security statutory requirements, and (4) develop security standards for national security systems. The OMB must require the heads of agencies (currently, agencies generally) to: (1) report on the adequacy of their information security procedures, (2) provide for independent evaluations of information security practices, and (3) notify Congress and affected individuals of data breaches. Intelligence community agencies affected by data breaches must notify NIST. Chief information officers of agencies must collaborate with their agency head to designate chief information security officers (positions with job responsibilities to be developed by the OMB and NIST) to replace their current senior agency information security officers. Agencies must develop mandatory annual information security training and certification to ensure that agency heads understand federal cybersecurity policy regarding: (1) agency systems, (2) cyber-attacks and data breaches, and (3) not using private email servers or messaging systems for official communications. Agency heads must certify that their agencies meet information security standards and provide reasons for not meeting any standards.  Agency heads must also develop annual plans to implement information security recommendations of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and inspectors general. If an agency head fails to implement such a recommendation, the reasons for the failure must be provided to the OMB for approval.  For each OMB-defined \"major cybersecurity incident\" (e.g., an incident involving classified information) that an agency experiences, the agency head must transmit an inspector general-performed independent evaluation to the OMB, the Department of Homeland Security, NIST, Congress, and the GAO. If the evaluation determines that the incident occurred because the agency head failed to comply sufficiently with NIST certification standards or recommendations of the GAO or agency inspectors general, then the OMB must hold the agency head accountable through an enforcement action, which may include actions under the budgetary or appropriations process, a recommendation for the President to remove or demote the agency head, or actions to ensure that the agency head does not receive cash or pay awards or bonuses for one year.

Each such increase shall be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date (rounded to the next lower dollar amount if the amount is not a whole dollar amount).  The VA may adjust administratively the rates of disability compensation payable to persons receiving benefits pursuant to public laws administered by the VA on December 31, 1958 (that are still in effect) who have not received service-connected disability or death compensation.   The VA shall publish such increased amounts in the Federal Register. (Sec. 3) The VA may pay the cost of transporting a deceased veteran:   who died as the result of a service-connected disability, or who died while in receipt of disability compensation, to a national cemetery or a state- or tribal-owned veterans' cemetery in which the deceased veteran is eligible to be buried, or  who has no next of kin or other person claiming the body to a national cemetery in which the deceased veteran is eligible to be buried.   Such payment shall not exceed the cost of transportation to the national cemetery nearest to the veteran's last place of residence in which burial space is available. (Sec. 4) The VA shall furnish at a private cemetery, upon request, a headstone, marker, or medallion that signifies the status of an eligible veteran who served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917, as a Medal of Honor recipient.  If the VA furnished a headstone, marker, or medallion for a deceased veteran that does not signify his or her status as a Medal of Honor recipient, the VA shall, upon request, replace that headstone, marker, or medallion with one that signifies such status.  (Sec. 5) The bill authorizes award of the Presidential Memorial Certificate to certain deceased members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces and certain deceased members of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. (Sec. 6) The Department of the Army shall reserve 100 in-ground burial plots at Arlington National Cemetery for interment of deceased Medal of Honor recipients. Such requirement shall terminate when the Army submits a report on the cemetery's interment and inurnment capacity that includes: (1) the estimated date of achieving maximum capacity; and (2) recommendations to ensure that such capacity is not reached until well into the future, including actions to redefine interment eligibility and considerations for cemetery expansion. (Sec. 7) The VA, beginning not later than October 1, 2016, shall carry out a three-year pilot program under which the VA shall carry out Veteran Engagement Team events to assist veterans in completing VA disability and pension claims.  Such events shall be carried out:   during the first year, at least once a month within the jurisdiction of each of 10 VA regional offices, including at least 2 regional offices in each of the 5 districts of the Veterans Benefits Administration;  during each of the second and third years, at least once a month within the jurisdiction of each of 15 VA regional offices, including at least 3 regional offices in each district;  at different locations within each regional office's jurisdiction and at least 50 miles from any regional office;  during the sponsoring regional office's normal business hours; and   with a sufficient number of physicians (to be available for opinions only), veteran service and rating representatives, and other appropriate claims personnel to initiate, update, and finalize the completion and adjudication of claims.    The VA shall: (1) collect and analyze event-satisfaction information from attending veterans, and (2) report annuallys on event implementation.  The VA may not permanently transfer any Veterans Health Administration physician to staff an event.",

A deceased individual, for the purposes of such provision, is an individual who: (1) served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917; and (2) is eligible for a headstone or marker, or who would be eligible but for his or her date of death. (Sec. 3) \"Claim\" and \"formal claim\" (a claim submitted on a DOD- prescribed form) are defined for purposes of provisions relating to claims for benefits under laws administered by the VA.  (Sec. 4) The VA shall report quarterly to Congress for five years regarding submitted VA claims. Each report shall include the total number of:    claims submitted, including the total number of informal and formal claims;   forms indicating an intent to file a benefits claim;  claim notification letters that included an invitation to submit an additional formal claim and the total number of claimants who submitted such additional formal claim; electronically filed claims submitted; and  fully-developed claims submitted.   It is the sense of Congress that the VA should develop a form for increasing or reopening a claim that does not require resubmittal of information previously submitted on a formal claim form. (Sec. 5) The VA may pay burial and funeral expenses, accrued benefits, dependency and indemnity compensation, and non-service connected disability or death pension amounts to a survivor of a veteran who has not filed a formal claim if the record contains sufficient evidence to establish the survivor's entitlement to such benefits.  The date of receipt of such benefits application shall be the earlier of:    the date on which the survivor notifies the VA of the veteran's death through a death certificate or other relevant medical evidence indicating that the death was due to a service-connected or compensable disability, or   the date on which any other federal agency notifies the VA of the veteran's death.  The bill requires the VA to report to Congress on benefits paid pursuant to covered claims. (Sec. 6) The VA shall provide the following claimants priority when processing veterans benefits claims:   veterans who have attained the age of 70;  veterans who are terminally ill;  veterans with life-threatening illnesses;  homeless veterans;  veterans who were awarded the Medal of Honor;  veterans who are former prisoners of war;  veterans whose claims are being reviewed again in relation to a previously denied claim relating to military sexual trauma;  veterans who the VA determines, on a case-by-case basis, are seriously or very seriously injured; and  veterans whom the VA determinesshould otherwise be given priority for good cause.  (Sec. 7) If a veteran has submitted a medical opinion or report from a private physician in support of a disability compensation claim, the VA may not order a medical examination by a VA physician unless the VA provides the veteran with an explanation of why: (1) the submitted medical opinion or report was not sufficiently complete, and (2) additional medical evidence is necessary. This provision shall apply to medical evidence submitted one year after enactment of this Act by veterans who have not submitted any prior VA disability compensation claims. (Sec. 8) During the nine-year period beginning on December 1, 2016, whenever there is an increase in benefit amounts payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, the VA shall increase by the same percentage the amounts payable as veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled adult children, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. (Sec. 9) The process for appointment of fiduciaries for veterans is revised. If the VA determines a beneficiary to be mentally incompetent for purposes of appointing a fiduciary, the VA shall provide the beneficiary with a written statement detailing the reasons for such determination. A beneficiary may appeal such determination.  A beneficiary for whom the VA appoints a fiduciary may, at any time, request the VA to remove such fiduciary and appoint a new one. The VA shall comply with a good faith request if the fiduciary: (1) has received a fee from the beneficiary and a volunteer fiduciary is available to assist the beneficiary, or (2) is not acting in the beneficiary's best interests. The VA shall ensure that any removal or new appointment shall not delay or interrupt the beneficiary's receipt of benefits.  A VA-appointed fiduciary shall act independently of the VA and in the interest of the beneficiary.   A veteran may predesignate a fiduciary. If a beneficiary does not designate a fiduciary the VA shall appoint a fiduciary who is: (1) a relative, (2) a guardian, or (3) authorized to act on the beneficiary's behalf under a durable power of attorney.   The VA, if it determines that a commission is necessary to obtain the services of a fiduciary in the best interests of a beneficiary, may authorize a fiduciary appointed by the VA to obtain from the monthly benefits provided to the beneficiary a reasonable commission for fiduciary services rendered. Such commission shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) 3% of the monthly monetary benefits paid on behalf of the beneficiary to the fiduciary, or (2) $35. A commission may not be authorized for a fiduciary who receives any other form of remuneration or payment in connection with rendering fiduciary services for the beneficiary.  Temporary benefit payments to a person having custody and control of an incompetent or minor beneficiary are permitted.  Specified state and local agencies and nonprofit social service agencies may act as fiduciaries. The VA shall maintain a list of state and local agencies and nonprofit social service agencies that are qualified to act as a fiduciary.  The bill requires the investigation for the certification of a fiduciary to include criminal and credit background checks. A background check shall be performed each time a person is proposed as a fiduciary.  A person convicted of a federal or state offense may serve as a fiduciary only if the VA finds such person to be appropriate under the circumstances.  A fiduciary shall disclose the number of beneficiaries on whose behalf the fiduciary acts.  The VA shall: (1) maintain records of any person whose fiduciary status has been revoked, and (2) notify a beneficiary within 14 days after learning that the fiduciary has been convicted of a specified crime.   The VA shall investigate alleged misuse of benefits, and if substantiated, transmit such information to the Department of Justice and each federal agency that pays benefits to fiduciaries or beneficiaries. The VA shall, when determining whether a proposed fiduciary must furnish a bond, consider: (1) the existence of any familial or other personal relationship between the proposed fiduciary and the beneficiary, and (2) the care the proposed fiduciary has taken to protect the beneficiary's interests.  Each Veterans Benefits Administration regional office shall maintain specified fiduciary information.  A fiduciary must (currently, may) file an annual accounting of the administration of beneficiary benefits.  The VA shall conduct annual random audits of fiduciaries who receive a commission for such service.  (Sec. 10) The Board of Veterans' Appeals shall, for purposes of scheduling a veteran's appeal hearing at the earliest possible date, determine whether to provide such hearing: (1) at its principal location or at another VA facility or other federal facility within the regional VA's area, and (2) through the use of video conferencing or by an appellant's personal appearance. (Current law merely permits an appellant to request that a hearing be at the Board's principal location or at a VA facility located within the regional VA's area.) The Board shall notify the appellant of such decisions. Upon notification, the appellant may request a different location or type of hearing, and the Board shall grant such request while ensuring that the hearing is scheduled at the earliest possible date. (Sec. 11) The Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 is amended to extend until December 31, 2017, the VA's authority to provide for persons other than VA employees (i.e., contract physicians) to conduct medical disability examinations of applicants for VA benefits. A VA-contracted physicians may conduct such examinations at any location in any state, the District of Columbia, or a Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States so long as the examination is within the scope of the contract and the physician:    has a current unrestricted license to practice his or her health care profession;   is not barred from practicing such health care profession in any state, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. commonwealth, territory, or possession; and   is performing authorized duties for the VA pursuant to a contract.  The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 is amended to provide similar authorities for examination locations under the pilot program authorizing the VA to use contract physicians to perform medical disability examinations of applicants for benefits carried out through the Under Secretary for Benefits.  (Sec. 12) The VA shall: (1) carry out a five-year pilot program to provide a faster disability compensation appeals process, and (2) inform claimants about such program.  Appeals filed under the pilot program are described as \"fully developed appeals.\"  A claimant may elect to file a fully developed appeal by filing with the VA: (1) a notice of disagreement along with the claimant's written election to have the appeal determined under the pilot program, (2) all necessary evidence, and (3) a statement of the claim's supporting argument. A claimant who elects to file a claim under the pilot program may elect to revert to the standard appeals process at any time. Such reversion shall be final.  Such a claimant or an electing claimant who is later determined to be ineligible for the pilot program shall revert to the standard appeals process without any penalty other than the loss of docket number.  The VA shall transfer jurisdiction over a fully developed appeal directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  The Board shall:   maintain fully developed appeals on a separate docket;  hear fully developed appeals in the order received;  decide not more than one fully developed appeal for each four traditional appeals decided, though this ratio may be adjusted for fairness purposes after one year; and  decide each fully developed appeal within one year of a claimant's filing the notice of disagreement.   A claimant may not submit or identify to the Board any new evidence relating to a fully developed appeal after filing such appeal unless the claimant reverts to the standard appeals process.  The Board shall establish an office to develop necessary federal records, independent medical opinions, and new medical exams that the Board determines are necessary to decide a fully developed appeal.  The Board may not provide hearings for fully developed appeals.  (Sec. 13) The VA shall take steps to ensure that regional offices certify VA Form 9, Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals forms within one year of receipt. (Sec. 14) A commission or task force is established to evaluate the backlog of VA disability claims and appeals. The commission or task force shall: (1) carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the claims backlog and the appeals process and provide Congress and the President with initial, interim, and final reports; and (2) terminate 60 days after submission of the final report. (Sec. 15) The Department of Defense (DOD) shall accept additional documentation for verifying active duty service as a coastwise merchant seaman between December 7, 1941-December 31, 1946, for purposes of veterans' burial benefits and medal and decorations eligibility, including:  in the case of an individual who served on a coastwise merchant vessel seeking such recognition for whom no applicable Coast Guard shipping or discharge form, ship logbook, merchant mariner's document or Z-card, or other official employment record is available, applicable Social Security Administration records, together with validated testimony given by the individual or the primary next of kin that the individual performed such service between December 7, 1941- December 31, 1946; and  in the case of such an individual for whom such employment record has been destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, other official documentation demonstrating that the individual performed such service between December 7, 1941- December 31, 1946.  (These individuals shall not be entitled to other benefits based upon such service.)  DOD, when determining whether to recognize service performed during such period, shall recognize masters of seagoing vessels or other command officers who were authorized to document an individual for purposes of hiring for, or discharging from, the merchant marine.  DOD shall verify that an individual performed such qualifying service under honorable conditions without regard to an individual's sex, age, or disability.  (Sec. 16) The VA shall designate at least one U.S. city each year as an \"American World War II City\" based on the city's: (1) contributions to the war effort during World War II; and (2) efforts to preserve the history of such contributions, including through establishment of preservation organizations or museums, restoration of World War II facilities, and recognition of World War II veterans. Wilmington, North Carolina, is designated as the first such city. (Sec. 17) Congress: (1) expresses its appreciation to the men and women left permanently wounded, ill, or injured as a result of their service in the Armed Forces; and (2) supports the annual recognition of permanently disabled American veterans.  (Sec. 18) The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 is amended to extend through December 31, 2021, the pilot program of providing reintegration and readjustment services in group retreat settings to certain women veterans recently separated from military service.",

Each such increase shall be the same percentage as the benefits increase provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act, as of December 1, 2015. (Sec. 102) The VA shall publish such adjusted rates in the Federal Register. TITLE II--UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS (Sec. 201) The temporary expansion of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is extended till January 1, 2020.

In states implementing an HSA deposit system, residents who are enrolled in health insurance coverage that meets state standards receive monthly deposits in their HSAs either from states administering federal funds or as a tax credit paid in advance. States that administer deposits are entitled to payments from the Department of Health and Human Services for population health initiatives. States with an HSA deposit system must offer a health insurance plan that is continually available for enrollment and penalize residents who have a break in coverage. This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to disregard assets in an HSA for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility and benefits except for long-term care services. This bill amends SSAct title XVIII (Medicare) to require participating hospitals to limit costs to individuals for uncovered emergency medical care. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate the requirement that an individual have a high deductible health plan to be eligible for the tax benefits of an HSA.
