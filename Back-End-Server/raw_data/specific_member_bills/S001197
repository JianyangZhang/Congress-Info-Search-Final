The term \"born alive\" means the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut. Also, a health care practitioner or other employee who has knowledge of a failure to comply with these requirements must immediately report such failure to an appropriate law enforcement agency.  An individual who violates the provisions of this bill is subject to a criminal fine, up to five years in prison, or both.  An individual who commits an overt act that kills a child born alive is subject to criminal prosecution for murder. The bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of felony.  A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill.  ",

Burwell. Continuation coverage must be the same as an enrollee's coverage at the time of the decision, unless the health insurer modifies coverage for all similar enrollees. Individuals must elect continuation coverage within 60 days of the decision. Health insurers cannot raise premiums during the period of continuation coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) cannot enter into a new contract with a state to provide the state with technology from the federal health insurance exchange. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a new tax credit for individuals with continuation coverage that is equal to 65% of the amount paid for continuation coverage, with the percentage decreasing by 5% each month after six months. The Department of the Treasury must pay advance payments on the tax credit.  This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit HHS from waiving state Medicaid plan requirements in order to allow a state to undertake a demonstration project unless HHS establishes project spending limits that are reviewed by actuaries.",
