The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall prescribe such regulations with respect to judicial branch employees.  An \"innovative mobility technology company\" is an entity that applies technology to expand and enhance available transportation choices, better manages demand for transportation services, or provides alternatives to driving alone. A \"transportation network company\" is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers in order for a driver to transport the rider to a point chosen by the rider. This does not include a shared-expense carpool or vanpool arrangement that is not intended to generate profit for the driver.  (Sec. 3) The bill revises the reporting requirements regarding payments pertaining to official travel. Each agency must annually submit to the GSA data on agency payments for travel and relocation and an analysis of transportation costs.  The GSA shall make the data submitted publicly available upon receipt. The GSA shall annually submit to the Office of Management and Budget and to specified congressional committees an analysis of the data submitted for specified agencies and a description of any new regulations or changes to existing regulations.

The VA shall seek to enter into a contract using competitive procedures with one or more contractors to provide the scheduling capability. The VA's request for proposals shall be open to any contractor that has an existing commercially available, off-the-shelf online patient self-scheduling system that includes the capabilities to:  schedule, modify, and cancel appointments for primary care, specialty care, and mental health; support appointments for the provision of health care regardless of whether such care is provided in person or through telehealth services; view appointment availability in real time; make available, in real time, appointments that were previously filled but later cancelled by other patients; provide prompts or reminders to veterans to schedule follow-up appointments; be used 24 hours per day, 7 days per week; and integrate with the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture of the VA.  The VA shall seek to enter into an agreement with an appropriate non-governmental, not-for-profit entity with expertise in health information technology to independently validate and verify that the system used in the program and any other patient self-scheduling appointment system developed or used by the VA includes such capabilities. The bill sets deadlines for the validation and verification of such systems. The Government Accountability Office shall evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on each validation and verification conducted. By December 31, 2017, the VA shall certify to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs that such systems include such capabilities.  If the VA develops or begins using a new patient self-scheduling appointment system that is not covered by such certification, it shall: (1) certify that such new system includes such capabilities by 30 days after it makes the determination to replace the previous system, or (2) replace any such system developed that is in use with a commercially available, off-the-shelf online patient self-scheduling system that includes the specified capabilities.",

The SBA must establish a process by which these microloan intermediaries may apply for, and the SBA may grant, a waiver of this 25/75 allocation.

(Sec. 4) The SBA may not impose limitations on the repayment term of a loan by an intermediary to a small business or entrepreneur. This repayment term, however, may not exceed:  6 years for a loan of $10,000 or less, or 10 years for a loan greater than $10,000.  (Sec. 5) An eligible intermediary may include lines of credit among the short-term, fixed rate loans it makes to startup, newly established, and growing small businesses from SBA funds made available to the intermediary for working capital and the acquisition of materials, supplies, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. (Sec. 6) The Government Accountability Office shall:  compare the operations of a representative sample of eligible intermediaries that participate in the microloan program and of eligible intermediaries that do not, study the reasons why the latter do not participate, recommend how to encourage increased participation by intermediaries in the microloan program, and  recommend how to decrease the associated costs for intermediary participation.  (Sec. 7) The SBA Office of Advocacy shall report to Congress on the economic impact of a mandatory savings requirement on businesses eligible to participate in the microloan program, including on the benefits and costs of such a requirement, and make implementing recommendations.",
