The VA shall submit to Congress notice of, and justification for, a waiver within 30 days of issuance. The VA shall disapprove a course of education unless the educational institution providing it discloses publicly any conditions or additional requirements required to obtain the license, certification, or approval for which the course is designed to provide preparation.

For free-to-pay conversion contracts entered into on the Internet, the consumer's consent must be obtained: (1) before obtaining the consumer's billing information after notice is provided of the terms of the contract, and (2) before the initial charge or initial increase after the introductory period through a requirement that the consumer perform an additional affirmative action (e.g., clicking on a confirmation button) indicating consent to be charged the amount disclosed.  After the introductory period in such a free-to-pay conversion contract, and on a quarterly basis while the contract remains in effect, the consumer must be provided with a copy of the notification of the terms of the contract. In automatic renewal contracts, the consumer must be: (1) notified of the terms of the contract not later than 30 days before the end of the initial fixed period in the contract, and (2) provided a copy of the notification after the initial fixed period and on quarterly basis while the contract remains in effect.

DOE must carry out, within the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, a program for the research of energy storage systems (systems or strategies that improve the ability to shift the dispatch of energy in time, across multiple timescales). DOE must carry out a loan program for: (1) the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in a specific project, and (2) programs that finance the demonstration and deployment of multiple energy storage systems through a financial assistance program. Loans may only be used to fund programs relating to the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities.  DOE must carry out a technical assistance and grant program for: (1) disseminating information and providing technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems; and (2) making grants to those entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems.
