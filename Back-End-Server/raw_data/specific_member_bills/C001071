                "summary": " Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 TITLE I--EMBASSY SECURITY AND PERSONNEL PROTECTION  Subtitle A--Review and Planning Requirements (Sec. 101) This bill amends the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 to direct the Department of State to: (1) submit a list to Congress of diplomatic and consular posts designated as high risk, high threat posts; (2) determine if a post should be so designated before its opening or reopening; (3) regularly review existing diplomatic and consular posts to determine if any such post should be designated as a high risk, high threat post; and (4) provide to Congress monthly briefings on any plans to open or reopen a high risk, high threat post and emergency notification of a decision to open or reopen such a post in less than 30 days. (Sec. 102) The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 is amended to require: (1) U.S. diplomatic mission emergency action plans to include the threat from complex attacks, and (2) rapid response procedures to include options for deployment of additional military resources, including deployment at high risk, high threat posts. (Sec. 103) The Diplomatic Security Act is amended to require an accountability review board to recommend investigatory or disciplinary action if an individual's misconduct or unsatisfactory performance significantly contributed to serious injury, loss of life, significant property destruction, or a serious security breach at or related to a U.S. government mission abroad.  Subtitle B--Physical Security and Personnel Requirements (Sec. 111) It is the sense of Congress that the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program should prioritize the construction of new facilities and the maintenance of existing facilities at high risk, high threat posts.  The bill prohibits a U.S. diplomatic facility construction project from including office space or other accommodations for a federal employee if the employee's department or agency has not provided the State Department with the full amount of required funding.  (Sec. 112) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 is amended to authorize the State Department to award local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building on the basis of best value (as determined by a cost-technical trade off analysis). (Sec. 113) The Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 is amended to authorize the State Department to transfer certain FY2018 appropriations if necessary to implement the recommendations of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board or to prevent or respond to security situations and requirements.  (Sec. 114) The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to authorize the State Department to provide physical security enhancements at overseas educational facilities established for the children of U.S. government employees. (Sec. 115) A determination to use procedures other than competitive procedures to meet emergency security requirements, including physical security upgrades, protective equipment, and other immediate threat mitigation projects, shall not be subject to certain challenges. (Sec. 116) It is the sense of Congress that: (1) the Overseas Security Policy Board's security standards for facilities should apply to all facilities, and (2) such facilities should comply with waiver or exception requirements if in the U.S. national interest.  (Sec. 117) The State Department shall station key personnel for sustained periods of time at high risk, high threat posts in order to: (1) establish institutional knowledge and situational awareness that would allow for a fuller familiarization with the local political and security environment, and (2) ensure that necessary security procedures are implemented.  (Sec. 118) The State Department shall submit to Congress a comprehensive report regarding ongoing embassy construction projects and major embassy security upgrade projects. (Sec. 119) The State Department may improve or construct facilities overseas for other federal agencies on an advance-of-funds or reimbursable basis if such advances or reimbursements are credited to the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account and remain available until expended. Subtitle C--Security Training (Sec. 121) The bill requires that personnel and senior and mid-level officials serving in high risk, high threat posts receive specified security training. (Sec. 122) It is the sense of Congress that diplomatic security personnel assigned permanently to, or who are in long-term temporary duty status at, a high risk, high threat post should receive appropriate language training.  Subtitle D--Expansion of the Marine Corps Security Guard Detachment Program  (Sec. 131) The State Department shall conduct an annual review of the Marine Corps security guard program to assess: (1) whether it is adequate to meet global diplomatic security requirements, (2) appropriate deployment, and (3) mission objectives and procedural rules of engagement. TITLE II--OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS (Sec. 201) The bill grants competitive status for appointment to a position in the competitive service to any qualified employee of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction who was not terminated for cause and who completes at least 12 months of service at any time before October 5, 2013.  (Sec. 202) The State Department shall certify to Congress annually for five years the independence and integrity of information technology systems of the Office of Inspector General (IG) of the Department and Broadcasting Board of Governors.  (Sec. 203) Each State Department entity under the Foreign Service Act of 1980 shall report to the IG within five business days any allegations of: (1) program waste, fraud, or abuse; (2) criminal or serious misconduct on the part of an employee at the FS-1, GS-15, or GM-15 level or higher; (3) criminal misconduct on the part of any employee; and (4) serious, noncriminal misconduct on the part of any individual who is authorized to carry a weapon, make arrests, or conduct searches.  (Sec. 204) The IG shall report to Congress regarding the requirement to audit the operations of each Foreign Service post and each bureau or other State Department office.

Specified sanctions against Iran are continued until the President certifies that the following Iranian activities have ceased: (1) support for terrorism, (2) development of ballistic missile programs or delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, (3) human rights abuses, and (4) undermining of cyber security. The President shall impose property blocking sanctions against any person that has engaged in significant activities undermining cyber security by or on behalf of Iran.  The President may not issue any license under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to an offshore dollar clearing entity to conduct a transaction with an Iranian financial institution in U.S. dollars.  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is amended to subject to sanctions: (1) u-turn transactions (fund transfers from a foreign bank that pass through a U.S. financial institution and are then transferred to a second foreign bank), and (2) book transfers (fund transfers for the benefit of an Iranian financial institution made between accounts of the same financial institution).  The President is authorized and encouraged to impose asset blocking and U.S. exclusion sanctions against any Iranian official who is responsible for, or complicit in, directing acts of significant corruption in Iran. The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 is extended through December 31, 2026. The bill sets forth reporting requirements with respect to: (1) Iran's use of sanction relief funds, (2) offshore U.S. dollar clearing for Iranian transactions, (3) U.S.-European Union sanctions coordination, (4) Iranian nuclear weapons research and development, (5) Iran-North Korea nuclear cooperation, (6) Iranian use of commercial aircraft and related services for illicit military or other activities, and (7) U.S. citizens detained by Iran. Treasury shall publish in the Federal Register an IRGC Watch List. It is the sense of Congress that the President should engage with international partners to ensure that the International Atomic Energy Agency is fully funded in order to undertake its verification responsibilities. The bill exempts certain humanitarian and national security activities from sanctions. Upon receipt of credible information that a person is engaged in sanctionable activity, the President shall initiate an investigation to determine whether such person is subject to sanctions.",
