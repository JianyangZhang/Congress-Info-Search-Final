Russell National School Lunch Act; the Internal Revenue Code; the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act; and several agricultural laws.  The bill expands and establishes federal grant and loan programs to:    improve the nutritional health of children and raise awareness about food waste,   improve cooperation between agricultural producers and emergency feeding organizations,  assist schools in using food from farms that would otherwise go to waste and providing farms with compostable materials, and   install facilities that include composting or anaerobic digesters that use food or crop waste to produce energy.   Recipients of grants to install anaerobic digesters that use waste to produce energy must meet specified requirements regarding environmental laws and the distribution of certain food to hunger-serving organizations.  USDA must: (1) establish an Office of Food Recovery to coordinate federal programs to measure and reduce food waste, and (2) study techniques for decreasing food waste and estimating the amount of food wasted by farms.  The bill provides that composting is a conservation practice eligible for support under USDA's conservation programs.  The bill extends and expands tax deductions for the donation of food to charitable organizations.  \"Sell-by\" dates included on food labeling must indicate that the dates are only the manufacturer's suggestion and use uniform language.  Companies that receive food service contracts with the federal government must donate surplus food to nonprofit organizations that assist food-insecure people. ",

Each report shall include:   the number of covered claims submitted or considered;  the number and percentage of such claims submitted by each sex, and the number of claims approved or denied;  the number and percentage, listed by each sex, of approved covered claims assigned to each rating percentage;  the three most common reasons for denial of covered claims, and the number of denials based on the veteran's failure to report for a medical examination;  the number of covered claims pending and the number on appeal;  the average number of days that covered claims take to complete; and  a description of related training provided to Veterans Benefits Administration employees.  The VA shall submit to Congress an initial report within 90 days after enactment of this Act, and annual reports beginning in December 2015.  It is the sense of Congress that the VA should update regulations regarding military sexual trauma by:   ensuring that military sexual trauma is specified as an in-service stressor in determining the service-connection of post-traumatic stress disorder, and  recognizing the full range of physical and mental disabilities (including depression, anxiety, and other disabilities as indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association) that can result from military sexual trauma.   For the period starting fifteen months after enactment of this Act and lasting until VA publishes updated regulations, the VA shall provide:   a copy of the congressional report to each veteran who has submitted a covered claim or been treated for military sexual trauma at a VA medical facility; and  monthly to each such veteran information that includes the date that the VA plans to complete such updated regulations, the number of granted or denied covered claims, a comparison to the rate of grants and denials with the rate for other claims regarding post-traumatic stress disorder, the three most common reasons for claim denials, and the average time for processing covered claims at each regional office.   The VA shall report to Congress monthly regarding: (1) all adjudicated covered claims and their outcomes, and (2) the reason for denial of any covered claim.  (Sec. 3) The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 is amended to limit to $2 million during each of FY2016-FY2018 the aggregate amount of awards and bonuses paid to VA employees who are members of the Senior Executive Service.",
