Joinder of such a defendant is fraudulent if the court finds:   actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts with respect to that defendant,    state law would not plausibly impose liability on that defendant,    state or federal law bars all claims in the complaint against that defendant, or     no good faith intention to prosecute the action against that defendant or to seek a joint judgment including that defendant.  In determining whether to grant or deny such a motion for remand, the court: (1) may permit pleadings to be amended; and (2) must consider the pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence submitted by the parties. A federal court finding that all such defendants have been fraudulently joined must: (1) dismiss without prejudice the claims against those defendants, and (2) deny the motion for remand. ",
