The bill expands the categories of public accommodations to include places or establishments that provide:   exhibitions, recreation, exercise, amusement, gatherings, or displays;  goods, services, or programs, including a store, a shopping center, an online retailer or service provider, a salon, a bank, a gas station, a food bank, a service or care center, a shelter, a travel agency, a funeral parlor, or a health care, accounting, or legal service; or  transportation services.  \"Establishment\" shall not be construed to be limited to a physical facility or place. Protections against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin must include protections against discrimination based on: (1) an association with another person who is a member of such a protected class; or (2) a perception or belief, even if inaccurate, that an individual is a member of such a protected class. The bill prohibits the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 from providing a claim, defense, or basis for challenging such protections.

The bill includes among the entities with whom the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is required to consult in conducting each review appropriate advisory committees established pursuant to such Act or otherwise, including the Homeland Security Advisory Council, the Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee, and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  DHS's outline and prioritization of the full range of critical homeland security mission areas of the nation for each review must be based on a risk assessment of the nation's homeland security interests.  Each review shall include a description of: (1) the resources required for the homeland security program (currently, a budget plan for such program); and (2) the resources required to execute the missions called for in the homeland security strategy and the homeland security mission areas (currently, a budget plan for such resources), including any resources identified from redundant, wasteful, or unnecessary capabilities and capacities that may be redirected to better support other existing capabilities and capacities, as the case may be. DHS must submit the report on each review within 60 days after the date of submission of the President's budget for the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which such a review is required (currently by December 31 of the year in which the review is conducted). The bill repeals requirements that DHS review and assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms of DHS for executing the process of turning the requirements developed in each review into an acquisition strategy and expenditure plan. But DHS must provide information on the degree to which the findings and recommendations developed in each review were integrated into DHS's acquisition strategy and expenditure plans. DHS must retain and, upon request, provide specified documentation regarding each review, including: (1) records regarding the consultation carried out; and (2) information regarding such risk assessment of the nation's homeland security interests. This bill shall apply to each quadrennial homeland security review conducted after December 31, 2021. ",

DHS may waive such submission requirement for such a program for a fiscal year if the program: (1) has not entered the full rate production phase in the acquisition lifecycle, had a reasonable cost estimate established, and had a system configuration defined fully; or (2) does not meet the definition of capital asset, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.  DHS shall make available to Congress, at the same time the President's budget is submitted for a fiscal year, information on the requirements of this Act in the prior fiscal year, including the following information regarding each program for which DHS has waived the submission requirement:   the grounds for granting a waiver for that program; the projected cost of that program; the proportion of a component's or office's annual acquisition budget attributed to that program; and information on the significance of the program with respect to the component's operations and execution of its mission.

DHS must submit the report on each review within 60 days after the date of submittal of the President's budget for the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which such a review is required (currently by December 31 of the year in which the review is conducted). The bill repeals requirements that DHS review and assess the effectiveness of the mechanisms of DHS for executing the process of turning the requirements developed in each review into an acquisition strategy and expenditure plan. But DHS must provide information on the degree to which the findings and recommendations developed in each review were integrated into DHS's acquisition strategy and expenditure plans. DHS must retain and, upon request, provide specified documentation regarding each review, including: (1) records regarding the consultation carried out, and (2) information regarding the risk assessment of the nation's homeland security interests.

(The WOTC permits employers that hire individuals with certain personal characteristics to claim a tax credit equal to a portion of the wages paid to those individuals.) A qualified older long-term unemployment recipient is an individual who is certified by the designated local agency as:  being at least 55 years of age on the hiring date, and  qualified as a long-term unemployment recipient under current law by being unemployed for at least 27 consecutive weeks and receiving state or federal unemployment compensation during that period.  The bill limits to $14,000 the amount of the qualified first-year wages which may be taken into account under the WOTC for a qualified older long-term unemployment recipient. ",
