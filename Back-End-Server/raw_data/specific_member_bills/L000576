A voucher may be revoked if the new medication is not marketed in the United States within one year of approval. A voucher may not be used: (1) to extend the marketing exclusivity period for a drug for which the FDA requires an assessment of the safety and effectiveness in newborns, or (2) on the same product as a priority review voucher. A sponsor intending to use a voucher must notify the FDA at least 15 months before the expiration of the patents or exclusivity to be extended.
