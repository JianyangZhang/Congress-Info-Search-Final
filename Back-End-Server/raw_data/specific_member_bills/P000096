H-1B employer application requirements are revised.  The bill establishes an H-1B visa allocation system, with first priority reserved for aliens who have earned an advanced degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from a U.S. institution of higher education. The bill requires completion of a U.S. degree (or an equivalent foreign degree) as a qualification for \"specialty occupation\" eligibility, eliminating experience in a specialty as an equivalent to the completion of such a degree.   The bill prescribes an H-1B labor condition application fee.  The Department of Labor may issue subpoenas and seek appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations to ensure H-1B employer compliance. The period of authorized admission for an H-1B nonimmigrant is reduced from six to three years, with a three-year extension available for aliens with extraordinary ability or with advanced degrees or professors. The bill denies an H-1B visa to any alien normally classifiable as an H-1 nonimmigrant who seeks U.S. admission to provide services in a specialty occupation. Labor may investigate applications for fraud and conduct H-1B compliance audits.  Labor shall conduct annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees who work in the United States if more than 15% of those employees are H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill increases certain employer penalties, including the penalty for displacing a U.S. worker. An employer that violates any H-1B requirement shall be liable to the harmed employee for lost wages and benefits.  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall give Labor any information in materials submitted by H-1B employers as part of the petition adjudication process that indicates employer noncompliance with H-1B visa program requirements.  Labor may hire 200 additional employees to administer H-1B programs. The bill prohibits an employer, unless it receives a waiver from Labor, from hiring for more than one year an L-1 nonimmigrant who will: (1) serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge, and (2) be stationed primarily at the worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer.  No employer may replace a U.S. worker with an L-1 worker.   The bill prescribes L-1 requirements regarding: (1) employer petitions for employment at a new office, (2) wage rates and working conditions, and (3) employer penalties.  Labor may initiate an L-1 employer investigation.  Authority to administer L-1 visa blanket petitions is transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security.",

H-1B employer application requirements are revised.  The bill establishes an H-1B visa allocation system, with first priority reserved for aliens who have earned an advanced degree in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from a U.S. institution of higher education. The bill requires completion of a U.S. degree (or an equivalent foreign degree) as a qualification for \"specialty occupation\" eligibility, eliminating experience in a specialty as an equivalent to the completion of such a degree.   The bill prescribes an H-1B labor condition application fee.  The Department of Labor may issue subpoenas and seek appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations to ensure H-1B employer compliance. The period of authorized admission for an H-1B nonimmigrant is reduced from six to three years, with a three-year extension available for aliens with extraordinary ability or with advanced degrees, or professors. The bill denies an H-1B visa to any alien normally classifiable as an H-1 nonimmigrant who seeks U.S. admission to provide services in a specialty occupation. Labor may investigate applications for fraud and conduct H-1B compliance audits.  Labor shall conduct annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees who work in the United States if more than 15% of those employees are H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill increases certain employer penalties, including the penalty for displacing a U.S. worker. An employer that violates any H-1B requirement shall be liable to the harmed employee for lost wages and benefits.  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall give Labor any information in materials submitted by H-1B employers as part of the petition adjudication process that indicates employer noncompliance with H-1B visa program requirements.  Labor may hire 200 additional employees to administer H-1B programs. The bill prohibits an employer, unless it receives a waiver from Labor, from hiring an L-1 nonimmigrant for more than one year who will: (1) serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge, and (2) be stationed primarily at the worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer.  No employer may replace a U.S. worker with an L-1 worker.   The bill prescribes L-1 requirements regarding: (1) employer petitions for employment at a new office, (2) wage rates and working conditions, and (3) employer penalties.  Labor may initiate an L-1 employer investigation.  Authority to administer L-1 visa blanket petitions is transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security.",

For primary sales, sellers must: (1) disclose at least seven days prior to sale, the total number of tickets the seller is offering and the total number and distribution method of tickets not available to the general public; (2) print on each ticket the distribution method, date, and time of the primary sale; (3) disclose service fees, convenience charges, and parking fees and provide refunds for such charges; and (4) provide full refunds for nontransferable tickets if requested by the consumer by one week prior to the event. Primary sellers are prohibited from requiring that consumers only be permitted to resell tickets in a manner determined by the primary seller.  For secondary sales, the secondary ticket sales marketplace must: (1) disclose if it does not possess the ticket at the time of sale, and (2) explain refund procedures if the ticket received does not match the description by the secondary marketplace.  The secondary sales rules must prohibit the use of software to circumvent a security system or access control measure on a primary ticket seller's website that is used to ensure equitable consumer access to tickets.  The secondary marketplace must disclose: (1) the distribution method and face value of each ticket; (2) the location of the seats or space; and (3) if the marketplace purchased the ticket during a public sale, the date and time of the purchase by the secondary marketplace.  Online marketplace resellers are: (1) prohibited from representing an affiliation or endorsement with venues, teams, or artists without their consent, except when it constitutes fair use; and (2) required to post notice on their websites indicating that they are conducting secondary sales and requiring users to confirm having read such notice before starting a transaction. Individual employees of venues, primary ticket sellers, teams, artists, online resale marketplaces, or box offices are prohibited from reselling tickets: (1) for higher than face value, or (2) to third parties for resale for higher than face value.  Online marketplace resellers must disclose when the secondary marketplace of a ticket is the primary ticket seller, venue, team, or artist associated with the event. The FTC and states are provided authority to enforce against violations. Persons may bring private civil actions to recover damages for injuries from violations.",
