A state energy security plan must:  address all fuels, including petroleum products, other liquid fuels, coal, electricity, and natural gas, as well as regulated and unregulated energy providers; provide a State energy profile, including an assessment of energy production, distribution, and end-use; address potential hazards to each energy sector or system, including physical threats and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities; provide a risk assessment of energy infrastructure and cross-sector interdependencies; provide a risk mitigation approach to enhance reliability and end-use resilience; and address multi-State, Indian Tribe, and regional coordination planning and response, and to the extent practicable, encourage mutual assistance in cyber and physical response plans.  In developing a state energy security plan, a state must coordinate with:(1)the public utility or service commission of the state,(2)energy providers from the private sector, and(3)other entities responsible for maintaining fuel or electric reliability. Upon request of a state, the Department of Energy (DOE) may provide information and technical assistance, and other assistance, in the development, implementation, or revision of a state energy security plan. DOE's authority to carry out this bill's provisions expires on October 31, 2022. ",

An individual whose income exceeds the applicable eligibility threshold due to qualified lump sum income shall continue to be eligible for medical assistance to the extent that the state determines that denial of eligibility would cause undue medical or financial hardship. With respect to an individual who loses eligibility due to qualified lump sum income, a state must provide specified notice and assistance related to the individual's potential enrollment in a qualified health plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Qualified lump sum income includes: (1) monetary winnings from gambling; (2) damages received in lump sums or periodic payments, excluding monthly payments, on account of causes of action other than those arising from personal physical injuries or sickness; and (3) income received as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual.",

(Sec. 3) The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) shall complete rulemaking for each such outstanding pipeline safety regulation before beginning any new rulemaking, except where there is a significant need to do so. (Sec. 4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall report on the integrity management programs for natural gas pipeline facilities and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. (Sec. 5) Two of the individuals selected for each Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and each Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee must be state officials (currently, state commissioners). DOT must consult with national organizations representing commissioners (as under current law) or utility regulators when making such a selection.  (Sec. 6) After completion of any pipeline safety inspection, DOT, or the certified state pipeline safety authority, shall:  conduct a post-inspection briefing with the natural gas or hazardous liquid pipeline operator, outlining any concerns, and provide written findings of the inspection.   (Sec. 7) DOT shall conduct a study on improving requirements for damage prevention programs for natural gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. (Sec. 8) The bill grants PHMSA authority to appoint qualified candidates to positions relating to pipeline safety. PHMSA shall report annually to Congress on:  the use of such authority, and its efforts to hire women, minorities, and veterans as inspectors.  (Sec. 9) DOT shall convene a working group to consider development of a voluntary information-sharing system to encourage collaborative efforts to improve inspection information feedback and information sharing regarding natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline integrity risk assessment and integrity management.  (Sec. 10) DOT shall:  report on the feasibility of establishing a national integrated pipeline safety regulatory inspection database to improve communication and collaboration between the PHMSA and state pipeline regulators; and issue minimum safety standards for the operation and integrity management, and environmental protection, of underground gas storage facilities.   The bill imposes a fee on the operator of an underground natural gas storage facility and establishes an underground natural gas storage facility safety account in the Pipeline Safety Fund to receive such fees.  (Sec. 12) Each hazardous liquid pipeline facility operator shall ensure that:   pipeline integrity assessments using internal inspection technology are done once every 12 months; and   such assessments using pipeline route surveys, pressure tests, external corrosion direct assessment, or other technology that determine the pipeline condition are completed on a schedule based on the risk that the facility poses to a high consequence area (urban area).  (Sec. 13) PHMSA shall require, and each hazardous liquid pipeline operator shall ensure, that any response plan includes procedures and a list of resources for responding to a worst case oil discharge and to a substantial threat thereof, including when such discharge may impact navigable waters or adjoining shorelines covered by ice.  (Sec. 14) The bill adds the Great Lakes and coastal beaches as areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage if there is a hazardous liquid pipeline accident. (Sec. 15) DOT may issue an emergency order, without prior notice or hearing, imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions, and safety measures for an unsafe condition or practice that constitutes or is causing an imminent hazard to a gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility.  (Sec. 16) DOT's Inspector General shall conduct an audit of the community pipeline safety technical assistance grants program to review compliance by PHMSA and grant recipients. (Sec. 17) DOT shall: (1) make available to the public the cost-benefit analyses of its rulemakings, and (2) identify the substantive changes between a draft rulemaking submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and the final version published in the Federal Register. (Sec. 18) The GAO shall report to Congress on corrosion control for gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities.  (Sec. 19) DOT shall enter into an agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to study regulatory requirements, techniques, and best practices for pipeline facilities transporting or storing only petroleum gas or mixtures of petroleum gas and air to 100 or fewer customers. (Sec. 20) The bill requires DOT to consider: (1) national security when prescribing minimum safety standards for deciding on the location of a new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility, and (2) cybersecurity measures in prescribing minimum operating and maintenance standards for such facilities. (Sec. 21) The bill reauthorizes through FY2021 the DOT gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and related programs, including PHMSA operational expenses, one-call notification program grants, community pipeline safety information grants, and the pipeline integrity program.

                "summary": "North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015  TITLE I--MODERNIZING AND PROTECTING INFRASTRUCTURE Subtitle A--Energy Delivery, Reliability, and Security  (Sec. 1101) This bill amends the Natural Gas Act to revise procedures for consideration by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) of applications for federal authorization of the exportation or importation of natural gas, including a deadline for a final decision on a federal authorization within 90 days after FERC issues its final environmental document.  The bill repeals an applicant's option to pursue certain remedies if a federal or state administrative agency fails to complete a mandatory approval proceeding in accordance with FERC's schedule. The bill prescribes requirements for: (1) concurrent federal and state application reviews, (2) issue identification and resolution, (3) failure to meet schedule, (4) remote environmental surveys, and (5) application processing that allows an applicant to fund third-party contractor to assist in reviewing the application. When an application requires multiple federal authorizations, FERC must track and publicize on its website the actions required to complete permitting, reviews, and other requisite actions.  (Sec. 1102) The Federal Power Act (FPA) is amended to require FERC, in resolving environmental and grid reliability conflicts, to ensure that any emergency order which may result in conflict with federal, state, or local environmental law or regulations:  requires electric energy generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission only during hours necessary to meet the emergency; is consistent with environmental law or regulation; and minimizes adverse environmental impacts.   An order that does conflict with federal, state, or local environmental law must expire within 90 days after issuance, although FERC may renew it for subsequent 90-day periods.  (Sec. 1103) The Department of Energy (DOE) shall:  adopt procedures, among other things, to improve communication and coordination between DOE's energy response team, federal partners, and the oil and natural gas industry regarding enhanced emergency preparedness for natural disasters; and  order 15-day (renewable) emergency measures to protect the reliability of either critical electric infrastructure or the defense critical electric infrastructure in the event of an imminent grid security emergency.   (Sec. 1104) FERC must establish a mechanism that permits owners, operators, or users of critical electric infrastructure to recover prudently incurred substantial costs of complying with an order for emergency measures if the costs cannot reasonably be recovered through regulated rates or market prices for the electric energy or services sold. Owners or operators of critical defense facilities that rely upon defense critical electric infrastructure, however, shall bear the full incremental costs of those measures.  DOE shall identify and designate U.S. facilities that are both critical to defense and are vulnerable to an electric energy supply disruption.  The bill prescribes requirements and restrictions for temporary access to classified information which DOE and federal agencies must provide with respect to a grid security emergency.  DOE must designate facilities located in the U.S. and its territories that may be defense critical electric infrastructure. The bill prescribes measures addressing grid security vulnerabilities: weaknesses that, in the event of a malicious act using an electromagnetic pulse, would pose a substantial risk of disruption to the operation of electrical or electronic devices or communications networks essential to the reliability of the bulk-power system. FERC shall direct the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to submit reliability standards that: (1) protect the bulk-power system from foreseeable geomagnetic storms or electromagnetic pulse events, and (2) address the availability of large transformers. The Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bonneville Power Administration shall be exempt for 11 years, though, from any requirement addressing grid security vulnerabilities under this Act.  (Sec. 1105) DOE shall submit to Congress a plan to establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in strategically located facilities, of spare large power transformers and emergency mobile substations in numbers sufficient to temporarily replace critically damaged large power transformers and substations that are critical to electric infrastructure, or that serve defense and military installations.  The purpose of the Reserve shall be to mitigate significant impacts to the electric grid from physical attack, cyber attack, electromagnetic pulse attack, geomagnetic disturbances, severe weather, or seismic events.  DOE may also establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve in accordance with the Plan. (Sec. 1106) DOE shall establish a voluntary Cyber Sense program to identify and promote cyber-secure products intended for use in the bulk-power system. (Sec. 1107) The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) is amended to require each electric utility to:  develop a plan to use resiliency-related technologies and other approaches designed to improve the resilience of electric infrastructure, mitigate power outages, continue delivery of vital services, and maintain the flow of power to critical facilities; develop and implement a plan for deploying advanced energy analytics technology; and adopt or modify policies to ensure that the electric utility incorporates reliable generation into its integrated resource plan to assure the availability of electric energy over a 10-year planning period.    Each state regulatory authority shall consider authorizing an electric utility to recover costs related to resiliency-related technologies, including a reasonable rate of return on its capital expenditures for those technologies.  A state regulatory authority must evaluate specified aspects of subsidizing customer-side technology. The bill exempts from PURPA any electric utility operations related to the competitive sale of retail electric energy that is unbundled or separated from the regulated provision or sale of distribution service.  (Sec. 1108) FERC shall conduct an independent reliability analysis of any proposed or final covered rule issued by a federal agency for which compliance with the rule may impact an electric utility generating unit or units. The analysis shall evaluate the rule's effects upon: (1) electric reliability and resource adequacy; (2) the U.S. electricity generation portfolio; (3) the operation of wholesale electricity markets; and (4) energy delivery and infrastructure, including electric transmission facilities and natural gas pipelines.  (Sec. 1109) DOE shall also evaluate annually each project it has conducted regarding carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies.  (Sec. 1110) The FPA is further amended to require each Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and certain Independent System Operators that operate capacity markets intended to ensure the procurement and availability of sufficient future electric energy resources to analyze for FERC how the structures of those markets meet specified criteria. (Sec. 1111) DOE and the Department of Commerce shall study the feasibility of establishing an ethane storage and distribution hub in the United States. (Sec. 1112) The bill expresses U.S. policy to promote and advance the modernization of the U.S. energy delivery infrastructure and of the electric grid to enable a robust multi-directional power flow. (Sec. 1113) DOE shall report to Congress on methods to increase electric grid resilience with respect to all threats, including cyber attacks, vandalism, terrorism, and severe weather.  (Sec. 1114) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall study ways to improve the capabilities of the National Response Center.  (Sec. 1115) The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to allow natural gas pipeline rights-of-way through all federally owned lands, including lands in the National Park System, except lands held in trust for an Indian or Indian tribe and lands on the outer Continental Shelf.  The Department of the Interior must: (1) identify and designate suitable federal lands as National Energy Security Corridors for construction, operation, and maintenance of natural gas transmission facilities; and (2) incorporate such Corridors into the relevant agency land use and resource management plans.  The governor of a state may request Corridors to be designated on federal land within that state. For purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) neither the designation of a Corridor, nor its incorporation into agency plans, shall be treated as a major federal action subject to environmental impact evaluation.  Applications for rights-of-way for natural gas transmission facilities across the designated Corridors shall be subject to specified environmental protections. Interior shall designate at least 10 National Energy Security Corridors in certain contiguous states.  (Sec. 1116) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to require Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), with respect to lands under their respective jurisdictions, to provide direction to ensure that all existing and future rights-of-way for electric transmission and distribution facilities on such lands include requirements, meeting specified criteria, for utility vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance activities. Interior and USDA shall:  give facility owners and operators the option to submit their own vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plans for approval; and develop jointly a consolidated and coordinated process for review and approval of those plans.  Interior and USDA shall apply their respective categorical exclusion processes under NEPA to any plans developed on existing transmission and distribution rights-of-way located on lands under their respective jurisdictions.  (A \"categorical exclusion\" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is required.)  An approved plan shall become part of the authorization governing the covered right-of-way and hazard trees adjacent to that right-of-way. A hazard tree is any tree inside or located outside a right-of-way that has been found likely to fall and cause a high risk of injury, damage, or disruption within 10 feet or less of an electric power line or related structure if it fell.  If vegetation on federal lands within, or hazard trees on federal lands adjacent to, an electric transmission or distribution right-of-way granted by Interior or USDA have contacted, or are in imminent danger of contacting, one or more electric transmission or distribution lines, the owner or operator:  may prune or remove the vegetation to avoid disruption of electric service and risk of fire; and shall notify the local agent of the relevant Department within 24 hours after such removal.   An owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility shall not be held liable for wildfire damage, loss, or injury, including the cost of fire suppression, if Interior or USDA fails to allow the owner or operator to:  operate consistently with an approved vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan on federal lands within or adjacent to a right-of-way to comply with federal, state, or local electric system reliability and fire safety standards; or perform vegetation management activities in response to an identified hazard tree or a tree in imminent danger of contacting the owner's or operator's transmission or distribution facility.   Interior and USDA should develop a program to train their personnel involved in vegetation management decisions relating to transmission and distribution facilities to ensure that they:  understand electric system reliability and fire safety requirements, assist transmission and distribution facility owners and operators to comply with applicable electric reliability and fire safety requirements, and encourage and assist willing owners and operators to incorporate vegetation management practices voluntarily.   Subtitle B--Hydropower Regulatory Modernization  (Sec. 1201) The Federal Power Act is amended, regarding the issuance of licenses for construction of dams, conduits, and reservoirs, to direct FERC, when deciding whether to issue a license for project works, to give equal consideration to minimizing infringement on the useful exercise and enjoyment of property rights held by nonlicensees. The licensee, in developing any recreational resource within the project boundary, shall consider private landownership as a means to encourage and facilitate private investment, increased tourism, and recreational use. (Sec. 1202) Upon request of the licensee for project 12642 (W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project in Wilkes County, North Carolina), FERC may extend the time during which the licensee must commence construction for up to three consecutive two-year periods from the date of the expiration of the extension originally granted.  (Sec. 1203) FERC shall be the lead agency to coordinate all applicable federal authorizations and for compliance with NEPA. Governmental entities and Indian tribes, when considering an aspect of an application for federal authorization, must coordinate with FERC and comply with its deadlines.  The bill prescribes intergovernmental administrative procedures affecting issue identification and resolution, scheduling, the scope of environmental review, and judicial review of a delayed federal authorization.  (Sec. 1205) FERC shall:  compile best practices in performing studies required in license proceedings; encourage all parties to a license application to use open-source methodologies and tools applicable across a wide array of projects, including water balance models and streamflow analyses; use current, accepted science toward studies and data in support of their actions; and develop comprehensive plans, on a regional or basin-wide scale, upon project applicant request, in in basins or regions having more than one project or application for a project.   (Sec. 1206) FERC may issue and amend licenses and preliminary permits for closed-loop pumped storage projects (in which the upper and lower reservoirs do not impound or directly withdraw water from navigable waters, or that are not continuously connected to a naturally flowing water feature). Before issuing such a license, FERC must assess the safety of existing dams and other structures related to the project, including the possible consequences of project failures. (Sec. 1207) The FPA is further amended to prescribe: (1) license amendments governing project upgrades, and (2) rules establishing new standards and procedures for license amendment applications.  (Sec. 1208) FERC may exempt from FPA license requirements any qualifying facility.  No federal authorization required for a qualifying facility may include any condition or other requirement that results in any material change to the storage, control, withdrawal, diversion, release, or flow operations of the associated qualifying nonpowered dam.   Unless FERC determines that its obligations under NEPA can be met through a categorical exclusion, its environmental review of a proposed exemption shall be only an environmental assessment.  TITLE II--ENERGY SECURITY AND DIPLOMACY  (Sec. 2002) DOE shall collaborate with the Secretary of State to develop recommendations for certain congressional committees regarding:  U.S. energy security valuation methods; improved planning and coordination with Canada and Mexico to enhance energy integration and strengthen North American energy security; improved collaboration with Caribbean and Central American partners on energy security; the strengthening of domestic energy security and the energy security of U.S. allies and trading partners; and the convening of at least two energy security forums to promote the collective energy security of the U.S., its allies, and its trading partners.   (Sec. 2005) The bill sets a deadline for DOE to issue a final decision on applications to export natural gas export if such applications must also obtain authorization from either FERC or the U.S. Maritime Administration to site, construct, expand, or operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. The Natural Gas Act is amended to direct DOE, as a prerequisite for approval of any authorization to export LNG, to require the applicant to disclose publicly the specific destination of any such authorized LNG exports.  (Sec. 2006) A permit to which NEPA applies for the construction, operation, or maintenance of an export facility for bulk commodities shall not be denied until each applicable federal agency has completed all required NEPA reviews.  (Sec. 2007) The bill requires a certificate of crossing for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of a cross-border segment of a pipeline or electric transmission facility for the import or export of liquid products or natural gas, or for the transmission of electricity, to or from Canada or Mexico.  The bill identifies the following officials responsible for issuance of a certificate of crossing :   the Secretary of State with respect to liquid pipelines; FERC with respect to natural gas pipelines; and  DOE with respect to electric transmission facilities.   A certificate of crossing is not required for modifications to existing projects unless those modifications would result in a significant impact at the national boundary.  The FPA is amended to repeal the requirement for a FERC order for the transmission of electric energy to a foreign country. (Sec. 2008) DOE must report to Congress on the weaknesses in currently available smart meters' security architecture and features (including an absence of event logging). TITLE III--ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY  Subtitle A--Energy Efficiency  Chapter 1--Federal Agency Energy Efficiency (Sec. 3111) The bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) to require each federal agency to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DOE, and EPA to develop an implementation strategy for the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies, taking specified performance goals into consideration.  OMB must establish performance goals to evaluate federal agency efforts to improve the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information technology.  (Sec. 3112) With respect to energy efficiency data centers, EISA 2007 is further amended to:  repeal the requirement that DOE and EPA designate an information technology industry organization to consult with and coordinate the voluntary national information program, and  require DOE and EPA to implement that program in collaboration with the information technology industry and other key stakeholders.  DOE and EPA shall also update for 2008-2015 the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency. In collaboration with key stakeholders and OMB, DOE shall maintain a data center energy practitioner program leading to the certification of energy practitioners qualified to evaluate the energy usage and efficiency opportunities in federal data centers. In addition, DOE shall:  establish an open data initiative for federal data center energy usage data, participate in harmonizing global specifications and metrics for data center energy and water efficiency, facilitate the development of an efficiency metric that measures the energy efficiency of a data center.  (Sec. 3113) DOE shall report to certain congressional committees on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use systems for potable hot and chilled water in federal buildings, and the return on investment of installing such insulation.  (Sec. 3114) GAO shall report to Congress on the potential of battery energy storage.  (Sec. 3115) The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is further amended to permit a federal agency to consider electric energy generation purchased from a facility to be renewable energy if the municipal solid waste used by the facility to generate the electricity is    separately collected from commonly recycled paper, and   processed in a way that segregates commonly recycled paper from non-recyclable solid waste.   (Sec. 3116) The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) is amended to prescribe energy consumption reductions for federal buildings in FY2006-FY2017. DOE shall report to Congress on the feasibility of requiring each federal agency to apply energy conservation measures to, and improve the design for the construction of, the agency's buildings so that the energy consumption per gross square foot of the buildings in each of FY2018-FY2030 is reduced by 3% from the comparable energy consumption in the prior fiscal year. The energy manager of each agency facility shall consider use of a system to manage energy as well as certification of the facility in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization standard numbered 50001, \"Energy Management Systems.\"  The bill prescribes criteria for exempting a federal agency facility from the annual comprehensive energy and water evaluation and recommissioning or retrocommissioning required for approximately 25% of the facilities meeting specified requirements, especially if the facility has received an evaluation within the past 8 years or been commissioned, recommissioned, or retrocommissioned during the past 10 years.  (\"Recommissioning\" means a process of commissioning a facility or system beyond its project development and warranty phases, the primary goal of which is to ensure optimum performance over its useful life while meeting building occupancy requirements. \"Retrocommissioning\" means a process of commissioning a facility or system that was not commissioned at the time of its construction.) (Sec. 3117) The Energy Conservation and Production Act (ECPA) is amended to revise energy efficiency performance standards for federal buildings. Current mandatory standards for green buildings are repealed, including specified reductions in fossil fuel-generated energy consumption.  (Sec. 3118) The bill authorizes the installation and use of battery recharging stations in parking areas designated for federal employees, except those installed or maintained by the Architect of the Capitol, as well as the imposition of fees to cover the costs of maintaining those stations. (Sec. 3119) DOE shall report to certain congressional committees on: (1) the impact of captured methane converted for energy and power generation on federal lands and buildings, as well as upon municipalities that use such generation, and (2) the return on investment and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of utilizing such power generation.  Chapter 2--Energy Efficient Technology And Manufacturing (Sec. 3121) The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) is amended to direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to initiate a rulemaking to consider noting prominently on any Energy Guide label for a product that includes Smart Grid capability that:  the product features Smart Grid capability,  the use and value of that feature depend upon the Smart Grid capability of the utility system in which the product is installed and the active utilization of that feature by the customer, and  using the product's Smart Grid capability on such a system could reduce the product's annual operation costs.   (Sec. 3122) DOE shall initiate a rulemaking to develop criteria with consensus support for achieving its recognition of approved voluntary verification programs, on whose testing it shall rely, for air conditioning, furnace, boiler, heat pump, and water heater products. (Sec. 3123) DOE shall also publish a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking for, or a notice of data availability updating the proposed rule, entitled \"Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy Conservation Standards for Residential Furnaces,\" in order to allow certain stakeholders to continue negotiations for a limited time period regarding the adoption of consensus energy conservation standards for nonweatherized residential gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces.  Between July 1 and July 31, 2016, DOE must publish a final rule, with recommended amendments, determining whether the standards for nonweatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces should be amended.  (Sec. 3124) EPCA is amended to declare that no disclosure about a product's participation in the Energy Star program either creates an express or implied warranty, or gives rise to any private claims under state or federal law relating to the disqualification of that product from Energy Star, if the product has been certified by an Energy Star program-recognized certification body, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved corrective measures with which the responsible party has complied fully. (Sec. 3126) DOE shall report to certain congressional committees regarding:    the use of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things end-to-end platform solutions to provide real-time actionable analytics and enable predictive maintenance and asset management to improve energy efficiency, a coordinated federal strategy to increase the beneficial reuse of used lubricating oil, including sustainable reuse options for used oil by federal agencies, federal grant recipients, federal contractors, and the general public.   (Sec. 3128) EPCA is amended to exclude from the meaning of \"external power supply\" any power supply circuit, driver, or device designed exclusively to be connected to and power either light-emitting or organic light-emitting diodes providing illumination. (Sec. 3129) DOE, however, may prescribe an energy conservation standard for such a power supply circuit, driver, or device. Chapter 3--School Buildings (Sec. 3131) EPCA is amended to direct DOE to establish a clearinghouse to disseminate information regarding federal programs and financing mechanisms that may be used to initiate, develop, and finance energy efficiency, distributed generation, and energy retrofitting projects for schools.  Chapter 4--Building Energy Codes (Sec. 3141) EPCA is amended to direct DOE to give technical assistance to help states, Indian tribes, and local governments implement technically feasible and cost-effective building energy codes.   By a specified deadline, states and Indian tribes must certify whether they have reviewed and updated the energy requirements of their respective building codes.  Full compliance shall mean:  at least 90% of building space covered by a building energy code in the preceding year substantially meets all requirements of the applicable code or achieves an equivalent or greater energy savings level; or the estimated excess energy use of buildings that did not meet the applicable code in the preceding year, compared to a baseline of comparable buildings that meet this code, is not more than 5% of the estimated energy use of all buildings covered by this code during the preceding year.  A state or Indian tribe shall be considered to have made significant progress toward achieving compliance if it has developed a plan for achieving compliance and has met the most recent target.  A state or Indian tribe not meeting building energy code requirements by the deadline shall submit a status report to DOE regarding compliance and certification. DOE shall give: (1) both technical assistance and federal support to states and Indian tribes in implementing codes, and (2) technical assistance for the development of voluntary programs that exceed the model building energy codes for residential and commercial buildings.  GAO shall study the impact of updating national model building energy codes for residential and commercial buildings. DOE shall study building energy code improvements, procedures to incorporate a 10-year payback in trade-offs and performance calculations, and legislative options, as well as best practices regarding delivery of aggregated energy consumption information to owners and managers of multitenant residential and commercial buildings. The bill prescribes requirements for DOE technical assistance for updating model building energy codes. (Sec. 3142) Any DOE program that may enable the owner of a commercial or a residential building to obtain a rating, score, or label regarding a building's actual or anticipated energy usage or performance shall be made available on a voluntary, optional, and market-driven basis. Chapter 5--EPCA Technical Corrections and Clarifications (Sec. 3151) The bill makes technical corrections to EPCA regarding product definitions and rulemaking procedures. Chapter 6--Energy and Water Efficiency  (Sec. 3161) DOE shall carry out a smart energy and water efficiency management pilot program that awards grants to demonstrate advanced and innovative technology-based solutions that:    increase and improve the energy efficiency of water, wastewater, and water reuse systems to help communities conserve water, save energy, and reduce costs;   support innovative processes and advanced automated systems that provide real-time data on energy and water; and   improve energy and water conservation, water quality, and predictive maintenance of energy and water systems, through the use of Internet-connected technologies, including sensors, intelligent gateways, and security embedded in hardware.   (Sec. 3162) EPCA is further amended to establish within the EPA a voluntary \"WaterSense\" program to identify water efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services that:   reduce water use;   reduce the strain on public and community water systems and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure;  conserve energy used to pump, heat, transport, and treat water; and   preserve water resources affecting products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services.  The EPA Administrator shall establish a WaterSense label and the procedure by which an item may be certified to display it. Subtitle B--Accountability  Chapter 1--Market Manipulation, Enforcement, and Compliance  (Sec. 3211) The FPA is further amended to rename the FERC Office of Public Participation as the Office of Compliance Assistance and Public Participation, which shall make recommendations for FERC rules to ensure that: (1) rates and charges for the transmission or sale of electric energy are just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential; (2) markets for electric energy transmission and sales are not impaired nor consumers damaged; and (3) the impact of FERC rules and orders upon small entities is taken into account.  Chapter 2--Market Reforms  (Sec. 3221) The GAO must study whether and how the current market rules, practices, and structures of each regional transmission entity produce rates that are just and reasonable. (Sec. 3222) The FPA is amended to limit the requirement for prior FERC authorization for the merger or consolidation of facilities to those facilities whose value exceeds $10 million.  Chapter 3--Code Maintenance  (Sec. 3231) EPCA is amended to repeal the mandates for specified DOE studies of off-highway motor vehicles and methanol plants.  (Sec. 3233) NECPA is amended to repeal the mandates for: (1) a Department of Housing and Urban Development study of residential energy efficiency standards and a presidential study of weatherization, (2) a DOE report to Congress on voluntary rating guidelines, and (3) the FERC national action plan for demand response. (Sec. 3236) The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to repeal the mandates for: (1) the annual General Services Administration (GSA) report to Congress on its activities involving energy management, (2) GSA intergovernmental energy management planning and coordination workshops, (3) federal agency Inspector General audit surveys and the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency report to Congress on each Inspector General review, and (4) GSA and Department of Defense programs for procurement and identification of energy efficient products. (Sec. 3241) The Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (PIFUA) is amended to repeal mandates for studies about: (1) national coal policy on alternative uses of coal, (2) compliance problems experienced by small electric utility systems regarding the use of coal and other alternate fuels as primary energy sources, (3) the socioeconomic impact of increased coal production and other energy development, and (4) the use of petroleum and natural gas in combustors. (Sec. 3246) The PIFUA is further amended to repeal the mandate for an electric utility conservation plan for electric utilities using natural gas as a primary energy source in an electric powerplant.

                "summary": " (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 - Title I: Communications Provisions - (Sec. 101) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to reauthorize and revise provisions expiring under the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA). Extends until December 31, 2019, the exemption from retransmission consent requirements (which prohibit multichannel video programming distributors [MVPDs] from retransmitting broadcasting station signals without the authority of the originating station) for satellite retransmissions of network station signals to subscribers located outside of a station's local market who reside in unserved households (commonly referred to as \"distant signals\"). Extends until January 1, 2020: (1) the prohibition on exclusive retransmission consent contracts, and (2) the requirement that television broadcast stations and MVPDs negotiate in good faith. (Sec. 102) Allows the FCC, following a written request with respect to a particular commercial television broadcast station, to add communities to or exclude communities from a station's local market. Directs the FCC to afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account: (1) whether the station has been carried historically within such community; (2) whether the station provides coverage or other local service to such community; (3) whether modifying the local market of the television station would promote consumers' access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their state of residence; (4) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a satellite carrier in such community covers news, sporting, and other events of interest to the community; and (5) viewing patterns in households that subscribe and do not subscribe to MVPD services. Permits the FCC to determine that communities are part of more than one local market.  Prohibits the FCC's market determinations from creating additional carriage obligations that are not technically and economically feasible for a satellite carrier by means of its satellites in operation at the time of the determination. Prohibits a satellite carrier from deleting from carriage the signal of a commercial television broadcast station during the pendency of any such proceeding. Requires the FCC's website to explain the market modification process, including information regarding: (1) who may petition to include communities within, or exclude communities from, a local market or television market; and (2) the factors the FCC takes into account.  (Sec. 103) Directs the FCC to revise regulations governing the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent. Requires such revised regulations to prohibit television broadcast stations, unless such stations are under common de jure control permitted by the FCC, from: (1) coordinating negotiations or negotiating on a joint basis with another television broadcast station in the same local market to grant retransmission consent to an MVPD, and (2) limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry a television signal that has been deemed significantly viewed (or any other television broadcast signal such distributor is authorized to carry under current laws governing the carriage of local, distant, or significantly viewed television signals by satellite carriers or the carriage of local commercial television signals by cable operators) into the local market of such station.  Directs the FCC to review its totality of the circumstances test for good faith negotiations. (Sec. 104) Delays the FCC's amendments to joint sales agreement (JSA) rules under which a television station that sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time of another station in the same market is attributed an ownership interest subject to ownership limitations. Provides JSA parties an additional six months to comply with the amended rules.  (Sec. 105) Removes a prohibition against deletion or reposition of a local commercial television station during periods in which major television ratings services measure the size of local television station audiences (commonly referred to as \"sweeps\" weeks). (Sec. 106) Terminates, one year after this Act's enactment, the FCC's set-top box integration ban that prohibits MVPDs from placing in service new navigation devices that perform both conditional access and other functions in a single integrated device. Directs the FCC to establish a working group to identify and recommend standards for a not unduly burdensome, uniform, technology-neutral, software-based, downloadable security system that promotes the competitive availability of such devices. (Sec. 107) Requires a Comptroller General (GAO) report concerning changes to carriage requirements currently imposed on MVPDs that would be required or beneficial to consumers, if Congress implemented a phaseout of statutory compulsory licensing procedures (a licensing and royalty distribution system administered by the U.S. Copyright Office under which cable and satellite operators may retransmit programming, without negotiating with every copyright holder, by paying licensing royalties at statutorily-defined rates determined by Copyright Royalty Judges or by using a royalty-free license for the retransmission of local broadcasts) under federal copyright law.  (Sec. 108) Directs satellite carriers to submit annual reports to the FCC regarding: (1) the local markets in which television broadcast station signals are retransmitted with a community of license, and (2) the use and potential use of satellite capacity for the retransmission of local signals in each local market. Terminates such reporting requirements after each satellite carrier has submitted five reports. (Sec. 109) Requires the FCC to submit to Congress: (1) an analysis of consumers' access to broadcast programming from television broadcast stations located outside their local market, (2) alternatives to designated market areas to provide consumers with more programming options, and (3) recommendations to increase localism in counties served by out-of-state designated market areas. (Sec. 110) Requires the FCC's annual report on cable rates to include the aggregate average total amount that cable systems pay for retransmission consent.  (Sec. 111) Requires the FCC to establish a streamlined process for the filing of effective competition petitions (if the FCC finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system are not subject to regulation by the FCC, states, or franchising authorities) by small cable operators, particularly those that serve primarily rural areas. Prohibits this Act from being construed to have any effect on the duty of a small cable operator to prove the existence of effective competition. Title II: Copyright Provisions - Amends federal copyright law to extend until December 31, 2019, the statutory license under which satellite carriers retransmit distant television broadcast stations to viewers who are unable to receive signals for such stations in their local market. (Currently, the statutory licensing authority for such satellite retransmissions is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2014.) Expands the local service area for cable retransmissions of low power television stations. Title III: Severability - Provides that if any provision of this Act is held to be unconstitutional, the other provisions shall not be affected.",

Requires the Secretary of State, with respect to oil pipelines, or the Secretary of Energy (DOE), with respect to electric transmission facilities, to issue a certificate of crossing for the cross-border segment within 120 days after final action is taken under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), unless it is not in U.S. public interest. Directs DOE, as a condition of issuing a certificate, to require that the cross-border segment be constructed, connected, operated, or maintained consistent with the policies and standards of: (1) the Electric Reliability Organization and the applicable regional entity, and (2) any Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator with operational or functional control over the segment.  Exempts from such requirement any construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of a cross-border segment if: (1) it is operating for import, export, or electrical transmission upon the date of enactment of this Act; (2) the relevant permit or certificate of crossing has previously been issued under this Act; or (3) an permit application is pending on the date of enactment of this Act, until it is denied or July 1, 2016, whichever occurs first.  Retains: (1) the requirement to obtain approval or authorization under the Natural Gas Act for the siting, construction, or operation of any facility to import or export natural gas, and (2) certain authority of the President under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).  (Sec. 4) Amends the Natural Gas Act to declare that no order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is required for the export or import of natural gas to or from Canada or Mexico.  (Sec. 5) Amends the Federal Power Act to repeal the requirement that the transmission of electric energy to a foreign country necessitates prior authorization by FERC.  (Sec. 6) Declares that no Presidential permit shall be necessary for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility, including any cross-border segment. (Sec. 7) Declares that no certificate of crossing or permit shall be required for a modification to the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility that: (1) operates for the import or export of oil or natural gas or the transmission of electricity to or from Canada or Mexico as of the date of enactment of this Act; (2) for which a permit for such construction, connection, operation, or maintenance has been issued; or (3) for which a certificate of crossing for the cross-border segment of the pipeline or facility has previously been issued.
