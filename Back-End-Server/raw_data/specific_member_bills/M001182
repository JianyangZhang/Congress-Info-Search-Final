                "summary": "Small Business Credit Availability Act  (Sec. 2) This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to promulgate regulations that codify a specified order in Investment Company Act Release No. 30024, dated March 30, 2012.  Under Investment Company Act Release No. 30024 the SEC permitted the Ares Capital Corporation to:  continue to own (directly or indirectly) up to 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Ivy Hill ll Asset Management, L.P.; and make additional investments in Ivy Hill, in each case, following the time Ivy Hill shall be required to become a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The bill entitles a business development company (BDC) to treat such regulations as having been completed if the SEC fails to complete the regulations required by this bill.  The bill further states, however, that nothing in it shall prevent the SEC from issuing rules that address potential conflicts of interest between BDCs and investment advisers. The Investment Company Act of 1940 is amended to deem certain securities to be permissible BDC assets to the extent necessary for the sum of permissible assets to equal 70% of the value of a BDC's total assets (excluding specified noninvestment assets) if the aggregate value of such securities does not exceed 20% of the value of the BDC's total assets.  (Sec. 3) The asset coverage requirements of registered closed-end companies also applicable to BDCs shall be reduced from 200% to 150% if the BDC makes certain disclosures on its website, and its directors or general partners approve of the modified requirements. (A registered closed-end investment company may not issue, or sell, any class of senior security unless it represents an indebtedness and, immediately after the issuance or sale, it will have an asset coverage of at least 300%. This asset coverage requirement currently is reduced to 200% for most BDCs.)  As an additional requirement, a BDC that issues equity securities that are not registered on a national securities exchange (non-traded BDC) must extend, to each shareholder as of the date of the approval, an offer to repurchase the shareholder's equity securities, with 25% of them to be repurchased in each of the four quarters following the approval date. In the alternative, the non-traded BDC shall obtain, at a special or annual meeting of shareholders or partners at which a quorum is present, the approval of the 150% reduction in requirements by more than 50% of the votes cast. A BDC may issue more than one class of senior security which is stock but only if it is issued to and held by a qualified institutional buyer.  (Sec. 4) The SEC must revise various rules under the Securities Act of 1933, and related forms, so as to allow a BDC to use security offering rules (such as those enabling a registrant to be a Well Known Seasoned Issuer, use shelf offerings, and communicate directly with shareholders) which are available to other issuers who are required to file security issuance reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Should the SEC fail to complete such revisions in timely fashion, a BDC shall be entitled to treat those revisions as having been completed in accordance with the timetable set forth in this bill until the SEC does complete them.",

                "summary": "American Renaissance in Manufacturing Act - Title I: Creating a More Competitive Tax Code - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce to 25% of taxable income the income tax rate for corporations (currently, the maximum rate is 35%). Makes permanent: (1) the reduction in the recognition period for the built-in gains of S corporations, (2) the basis adjustments to the stock of S corporations making charitable contributions of appreciated property, (3) the expensing allowance for depreciable business assets, (4) the research tax credit, and (5) the additional depreciation allowance (bonus depreciation) for business assets. Title II: Reining In Job-Killing Washington Red Tape - States that the purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and transparency in the federal regulatory process by requiring Congress to approve all new major regulations.  Revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require a federal agency promulgating a rule to include in its report to Congress and to the Comptroller General (GAO) a classification of the rule as a major or nonmajor rule. Sets forth a congressional approval procedure for major rules and a congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to provide that any rule subject to such congressional approval procedure affecting budget authority, outlays, or receipts shall be assumed to be effective unless it is not approved in accordance with such procedure. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), before promulgating as final an energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion, to report to Congress on the effects of such rule on the economy and on employment. Prohibits the Administrator from: (1) using the social cost of carbon in any cost-benefit analysis relating to such energy-related rule; and (2) issuing, implementing, or enforcing any proposed or final rule under the Clean Air Act that establishes a performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit unless the rule meets specified requirements. Nullifies the force and effect of specified proposed rules (or similar successor proposed or final rules) for Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize states to adopt and implement coal combustion residuals permit programs.  Title III: Reducing Frivolous Legal Costs - Amends the sanctions provisions in Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require the court to impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that has violated, or is responsible for the violation of, the rule with regard to representations to the court. Requires any sanction to compensate parties injured by the conduct in question. Repeals the provision that prohibits filing a motion for sanctions if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets.  Authorizes the court to impose additional sanctions, such as striking the pleadings, dismissing the suit, or other nonmonetary directives or ordering penalty payments if warranted for effective deterrence. Amends federal bankruptcy law to require a quarterly report on asbestos claims. Revises pleading and procedural requirements for patent infringement actions. Directs the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to notify the public on its website when a patent case is brought in federal court. Codifies judicial doctrine relating to the consideration of prior art in cases of double patenting for the purpose of determining the nonobviousness of a second patent's claimed invention, thereby specifying that such doctrine continues to apply to the first-inventor-to-file patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.  Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to ensure that any emergency order issued under such Act for the interconnection of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy that may result in a conflict with a requirement of any environmental law: (1) requires generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest; and (2) to the maximum extent practical, is consistent with any other applicable environmental law and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts.  Title IV: Preserving Access to Abundant and Affordable Sources of Energy - Expedites the permit approval process for the Keystone Pipeline by eliminating the requirement for a presidential permit and other requirements.  Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve or deny a certificate of public convenience and necessity within 12 months after providing public notice of the permit application for a natural gas pipeline project. Prohibits any person from constructing, connecting, operating, or maintaining a cross-border segment of an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility at the national boundary of the United States for the import or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico without obtaining a certificate of crossing under this Act.  Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Department of the Interior from enforcing any federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing (including any component of that process), relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in any state that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for that activity.  Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to implement a leasing program that includes at least 50% of the available unleased acreage within each Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning area considered to have the largest undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources, with an emphasis on offering the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct specified oil and gas lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coasts of Virginia and South Carolina and to offer for sale leases of tracts in the Southern California area.  Allocates 37.5% of the amount of new federal leasing revenues to coastal states that are: (1) impacted by the leases under which those revenues are received by the United States, and (2) within 200 miles of the leased tract. Establishes in the Department of the Interior: (1) an Under Secretary for Energy, Lands, and Minerals; (2) an Assistant Secretary of Ocean Energy and Safety; (3) an Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Management; (4) a Bureau of Ocean Energy; (5) an Ocean Energy Safety Service; and (6) an Office of Natural Resources Revenue.  Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a National Offshore Energy Safety Academy to train oil and gas inspectors and other Department of Interior personnel; and (2) an Outer Continental Shelf Energy Safety Advisory Board to provide advice on mineral and renewable energy exploration, development, and production activities. Abolishes the Minerals Management Service. Prohibits the Bureau of Ocean Energy and the Ocean Energy Safety Service from developing, proposing, finalizing, administering, or implementing any limitation on activities under their jurisdictions as a result of the coastal and marine spatial planning component of the National Ocean Policy developed under Executive Order No. 13547. Redefines the OCS to include all submerged lands lying within the U.S. exclusive economic zone and the Continental Shelf adjacent to any U.S. territory. Sets forth requirements for filing complaints for judicial review of federal actions relating to energy leases.",
