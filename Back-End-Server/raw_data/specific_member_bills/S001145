The HHS review, which currently covers only premium increases, is expanded to include all rate increases. HHS or the relevant state agency must ensure that any excessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory rates are corrected before, or as soon as possible after, implementation, including through mechanisms such as denying rates, modifying rates, or requiring rebates to consumers. HHS may apply civil monetary penalties to health insurers that fail to comply with a corrective action taken by HHS and may make the plan involved ineligible for classification as a qualified health plan. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) HHS must determine whether HHS or the state will undertake the corrective actions based on whether the state can adequately undertake the actions.

Nurses may object to, or refuse to participate in, an assignment if it would violate minimum ratios or if they are not prepared by education or experience to fulfill the assignment without compromising the safety of a patient or jeopardizing their nurse's license. Hospitals may not: (1) take specified actions against a nurse based on the nurse's refusal to accept an assignment for such a reason; or (2) discriminate against individuals for good faith complaints relating to the care, services, or conditions of the hospital or related facilities. HHS must publish the names of hospitals penalized for violating the requirements in this bill. The bill adds stipends to the nurse workforce loan repayment and scholarship program.

Plans under the public health insurance option must be qualified health plans and must include plans with bronze, silver, and gold tier benefits. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) HHS must establish an office of the ombudsman for the public health insurance option. States may establish advisory councils to provide recommendations to HHS on the operations and policies of the public health insurance option. HHS must collect data to establish rates for premiums and health care provider reimbursement and for other purposes. Premium rates for public health insurance option plans must: (1) fully finance administrative costs and provided health benefits, and (2) include a contingency margin. HHS must negotiate rates for health care providers and prescription drugs under the public health insurance option. If HHS is unable to reach a negotiated agreement on rates, HHS must use Medicare rates. States may not tax federal receipts or disbursements attributable to the operation of the public health insurance option. HHS must establish conditions for participation by health care providers in the public health insurance option.
