The EPA must determine whether to grant experimental use permits for pesticides within specified time frames. The bill adds new categories of pesticide registration applicants who are subject to the registration service fees, such as applications for inert ingredients. The EPA must also identify opportunities for streamlining the review of applications to register a new active ingredient in a pesticide or a new use of a pesticide and for providing prompt feedback to applicants during the review process.",

                "summary": "Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or the FAST Act DIVISION A--SURFACE TRANSPORTATION  (Sec. 1002) Directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to reduce the amount apportioned for a surface transportation program, project, or activity for FY2016 by amounts apportioned or allocated under any extension of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) for the period beginning October 1, 2015, and ending upon enactment of this Act. TITLE I--FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS Subtitle A--Authorizations and Programs (Sec. 1101) Reauthorizes through FY2020:  certain core federal-aid highway programs; the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation program; the federal lands, tribal transportation, and federal lands transportation and access programs; the territorial and Puerto Rico highway program; and nationally significant freight and highway projects.  Requires the expenditure of at least 10% of amounts made available for federal-aid highways and public transportation programs through small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Directs states to compile annual lists of small disadvantaged business enterprises according to minimum uniform criteria established by DOT. (Sec. 1102) Prescribes obligation ceilings for certain federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs, with specified exceptions.  Prescribes requirements, including a formula, and restrictions for certain FY2016-FY2020 distributions from the obligation limitation for federal-aid highways. Directs DOT to redistribute to the states any federal-aid highway program funds that, because of any imposed obligation limitation, will not be allocated or otherwise made available to them for obligation for surface transportation program projects.  (Sec. 1104) Authorizes appropriations through FY2020 for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) administrative expenses. Revises and renames the surface transportation program as the surface transportation block grant program (STBGP) (as established by section 1109 of this Act). Requires DOT to set-aside specified amounts of a state's base apportionment of core program funds for the national highway freight program and metropolitan transportation planning. Directs DOT also to reserve certain amounts to states for:   the national highway performance program for FY2019 and FY2020, and  the STBGP through FY2020.  (Sec. 1105) Authorizes DOT to make competitive grants to a state or group of states, a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) that serves an urbanized area with a population of more than than 200,000 individuals, a unit of local government or group of local governments, or other specified entities to furnish financial assistance for nationally significant freight and highway projects.  Requires DOT to reserve out of such grant amounts for each fiscal year:   10% for small projects, and at least 25% for projects in rural areas.  Makes the maximum federal share of project costs 60%. (Sec. 1106) Revises requirements for the national highway performance program. Authorizes DOT, upon request, to allow a state to use its apportionment of national highway performance program funds to pay subsidy and administrative costs of Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program secured loans, loan guarantees, or credit for surface transportation projects for a state, local government, public authority, public-private partnership, or any other legal entity. Allows a state's apportionment to be obligated for projects:   for the reconstruction or rehabilitation of federal-aid highway bridges (non-National Highway System bridges), and to reduce the risk of failure of critical transportation infrastructure.  (Sec. 1107) Revises requirements for the emergency relief fund program.  Treats as an eligible expense for emergency relief program funding the costs of disaster debris removal for projects for the repair or reconstruction of federal-aid highways on tribal transportation facilities, federal lands transportation facilities, or other federally-owned roads that are open to public travel.  (Sec. 1108) Revises and reauthorizes requirements for the set-aside of highway safety improvement program funds for states for the same period for the elimination of hazards and the installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings. (Sec. 1109) Establishes in DOT an surface transportation block grant program (STBGP).

Directs the President to propose to Congress a strategy to pursue with other major exporting countries, including Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members and non-OECD members, to eliminate over a 10-year period subsidized export-financing programs, tied aid, export credits, and all other forms of government-supported export subsidies. (Sec. 55003) Directs the Bank to study the extent to which products it offers are available and used by companies that export information and communications technology services and related goods. DIVISION F--ENERGY SECURITY (Sec. 61001) Directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to adopt procedures to:   improve communication and coordination between DOE's energy response team, federal partners, and industry;   leverage the Energy Information Administration's subject matter expertise within DOE's energy response team to improve supply chain situation assessments;   establish company liaisons and direct communication with DOE's energy response team to improve situation assessments;  streamline and enhance processes for obtaining temporary regulatory relief to speed up emergency response and recovery;   facilitate and increase engagement among states, the oil and natural gas industry, and DOE in developing state and local energy assurance plans;  establish routine education and training programs for key government emergency response positions with DOE and states; and  involve states and the oil and natural gas industry in comprehensive drill and exercise programs.   Includes among these activities collaborative efforts with state and local government officials and the private sector. (Sec. 61002) Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to ensure that any emergency order that may result in conflict with federal, state, or local environmental law or regulations:  requires generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electricity only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest;  be consistent with applicable environmental law; and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts to the maximum extent practical.  Declares that any necessary action or omission in such an emergency that does not comply with federal, state, or local environmental law or regulation shall not be considered a violation of it, or subject the party involved to any related requirement, civil or criminal liability, or a citizen suit. Requires such emergency orders to expire within 90 days. Authorizes FERC to renew or reissue an order for subsequent periods of no more than 90 days each as necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.  Authorizes a municipality engaged in the transmission or sale of electricity, and not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to make temporary connections during an emergency with public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and construct necessary or appropriate temporary electricity transmission facilities, without becoming subject to FERC jurisdiction by reason of that temporary connection or construction. (Sec. 61003) Amends the Federal Power Act to authorize DOE, with or without notice, hearing, or report, to issue orders for emergency measures to protect or restore the reliability of either critical electric infrastructure or defense critical electric infrastructure whenever the President issues a written directive or determination identifying an imminent grid security emergency. Requires the President to notify specified congressional committees promptly upon issuing such a directive.  Defines \"critical electric infrastructure\" to mean a system or asset of the bulk-power system, whether physical or virtual, whose incapacity or destruction would negatively affect national security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of such matters.  Defines \"defense critical electric infrastructure\" to mean any electric infrastructure located in the United States (including the territories) that serves a DOE-designated facility, but is not owned or operated by the facility owner or operator.  Requires DOE to designate any such facilities that are: (1) critical to the defense of the United States, and (2) vulnerable to a disruption of the supply of electric energy provided by an external provider. Requires DOE, before issuing an order for emergency measures, to the extent practicable in light of the nature of the grid security emergency and the urgency of the need for action, to consult with governmental authorities in Canada and Mexico, certain entities, the Electricity Sub-sector Coordinating Council, and other appropriate federal agencies regarding implementation of the emergency measures.  Prescribes: (1) implementation procedures (including expiration and reissuance of emergency orders); and (2) related cost recovery measures affecting owners, operators, or users of the bulk-power system.  Directs DOE, to the extent practicable and consistent with obligations to protect classified information, to provide temporary access to classified information relating to a grid security emergency to key personnel of relevant entities in order to optimize communications between them and federal agencies. Exempts critical electric infrastructure information from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Directs FERC to: (1) designate critical electric infrastructure information, and (2) prescribe regulations and orders prohibiting its unauthorized disclosure but also authorizing appropriate voluntary sharing with federal, state, local, and tribal authorities.  Authorizes DOE also to designate critical electric infrastructure information. States that critical electric infrastructure information may not be designated as such, however, for longer than five years, and any designation shall be subject to judicial review. Declares that no cause of action shall lie or be maintained in any federal or state court for sharing or receiving information in accordance with this Act. Makes DOE the lead Sector-Specific Agency for cybersecurity for the energy sector to:  coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other relevant federal departments and agencies; collaborate with critical electric infrastructure owners and operators as well as independent regulatory agencies and state, local, tribal, and territorial entities; serve as a day-to-day federal interface for the dynamic prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; carry out incident management responsibilities; provide, support, or facilitate technical assistance and consultations for the energy sector to identify vulnerabilities and help mitigate incidents; and give DHS annually sector-specific critical electric infrastructure information to support its reporting requirements.  (Sec. 61004) Directs DOE, acting through the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, to submit to Congress a plan to establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in strategically located facilities, of spare large power transformers and emergency mobile substations in sufficient numbers to temporarily replace critically damaged large power transformers and substations that are critical electric infrastructure or serve defense and military installations to mitigate significant impacts to the electric grid resulting from physical attack, cyber attack, electromagnetic pulse attack, geomagnetic disturbances, severe weather, or seismic events. (Sec. 61005) Directs DOE also to develop and report to specified congressional committees, after public notice and comment, recommended U.S. energy security valuation methods. Requires the report to:  evaluate and define U.S. energy security to reflect modern domestic and global energy markets and the collective needs of the United States and its allies and partners; identify procedures and criteria to ensure that energy-related actions that significantly affect the supply, distribution, or use of energy are evaluated with respect to their potential impact on energy security, consumers and the economy, energy supply diversity and resiliency, well-functioning and competitive energy markets, the U.S. trade balance, and national security objectives; and  recommend an implementation strategy meeting specified requirements.  DIVISION G--FINANCIAL SERVICES  TITLE LXXI[sic]--IMPROVING ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES (Sec. 71001) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to reduce from 21 to 15 the number of days before a \"road show\" that an emerging growth company (EGC), before its initial public offering (IPO) date, may publicly file a draft registration statement for confidential nonpublic review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). (A financial \"road show\" is an offer [other than a statutory prospectus or a portion of one] that contains a presentation regarding an offering by one or more members of the issuer's management and includes discussion of one or more of the issuer, such management, and the securities being offered. Typically, a road show is a series of meetings across different cities, often before an IPO, in which top executives from a company have the opportunity to talk with current or potential investors.) (Sec. 71002) Prescribes a grace period during which an issuer that was an EGC at the time it filed a confidential registration statement (or, in lieu of that, a publicly filed registration statement) for SEC review, but ceases to be an EGC, shall continue to be treated as an emerging market growth company for one year or, if earlier, until consummation of its IPO. (Sec. 71003) Amends the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to direct the SEC to prescribe conditions under which a registration statement filed (or submitted for confidential review) by an issuer before its IPO may omit financial disclosure information for historical periods otherwise required. TITLE LXXII--DISCLOSURE MODERNIZATION AND SIMPLIFICATION (Sec. 72001) Directs the SEC to issue regulations permitting issuers to submit a summary page on annual and transition report form 10-K if each item on that page cross-references electronically or otherwise the material contained in form 10-K to which the item relates.  (Sec. 72002) Directs the SEC to revise regulation S-K (Standard Instructions for Filing Forms under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975) in order to:  reduce the burden on smaller issuers, including emerging growth companies, accelerated filers, and smaller reporting companies (while still providing all material information to investors); and  eliminate duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or unnecessary provisions.  (Sec. 72003) Requires the SEC to study ways to: (1) modernize and simplify requirements in regulation S-K, and (2) evaluate information delivery and presentation methods as well as explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. Directs the SEC also to issue a proposed rule to implement any recommendations it makes to Congress based upon the study. TITLE LXXIII--BULLION AND COLLECTIBLE COIN PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS (Sec. 73001) Repeals: (1) the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to change the design of certain gold bullion coins, and (2) requirements for the protective covering for certain bullion coins.  Repeals the copper content requirements for quarter dollar coins, and requires the silver content to be at least 90%. Makes technical revisions to the requirements for palladium bullion investment coins.   (Sec. 73002) Requires proof and uncirculated versions of American Eagle silver coins issued during calendar year 2016 to have a smooth edge incused with a designation that notes the 30th anniversary of the first issue of such coins.  TITLE LXXIV--SBIC ADVISERS RELIEF (Sec. 74001) Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to exempt specified advisers of small business investment companies (SBICs) from certain: (1) SEC registration requirements with respect to the provision of investment advice relating to venture capital funds, and (2) SEC registration and reporting requirements with respect to assets under management of private funds.  (Sec. 74003) Extends the same exemption to specified SBIC advisers with respect to any state or local law requiring the registration, licensing, or qualifications of investment advisers. TITLE LXXV--ELIMINATE PRIVACY NOTICE CONFUSION (Sec. 75001) Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to exempt from its annual privacy policy notice requirement any financial institution which: (1) provides nonpublic personal information only in accordance with specified requirements, and (2) has not changed its policies and practices with regard to disclosing nonpublic personal information from those disclosed in the most recent disclosure sent to consumers. TITLE LXXVI--REFORMING ACCESS FOR INVESTMENTS IN STARTUP ENTERPRISES  (Sec.76001) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from security registration requirements, and related prohibitions against using interstate commerce and the mails for the sale or delivery of securities after sale, any transaction where:  each purchaser is an accredited investor; neither the seller, nor any person acting on the seller's behalf, offers or sells securities by general solicitation or advertising; the seller and prospective purchaser obtain from an issuer meeting certain criteria reasonably current specified information; the transaction is not for the sale of a security whose seller is neither an issuer nor a subsidiary of the issuer; neither the seller, nor any person receiving remuneration for participating in the offer or sale of the securities, is subject to certain legal disqualification (bad actor); the issuer is engaged in business, is not in the organizational stage or in bankruptcy or receivership, and is not a blank check, blind pool, or shell company with no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that the issuer's primary business plan is to engage in a merger or combination of the business with, or an acquisition of, an unidentified person; the transaction does not involve a security that constitutes the whole or part of an unsold allotment to, or a subscription or participation by, a broker or dealer as an underwriter of the security or a redistribution; and the transaction does involve a security of a class authorized and outstanding for at least 90 days before the transaction.   Deems any securities acquired in such exempt transactions to: (1) have been acquired in a transaction not involving any public offering, (2) not be a distribution involving an underwriter, and (2) be restricted securities not subject to certain transaction requirements. Exempts all transactions under this Act from state regulation of securities offerings. TITLE LXXVII--PRESERVATION ENHANCEMENT AND SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY (Sec. 77001) Amends the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA) with respect to a plan of action the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may approve for extension of the low-income affordability restrictions on any eligible low-income housing.  Entitles the owner of a property subject to a plan of action or use agreement to distribute:  annually all surplus cash generated by the property, but only if the owner is in material compliance with the use agreement, including compliance with prevailing physical condition standards established by HUD; and any funds accumulated in a residual receipts account, notwithstanding any conflicting provision in the use agreement, but only if the individual is in material compliance with the use agreement and has completed, or set aside sufficient funds to complete, any capital repairs identified by the most recent third party capital needs assessment.  Requires an owner distributing any such amounts to:  continue to operate the property in accordance with the affordability requirements of its use agreement for its remaining useful life; continue to renew or extend any project-based rental assistance contract for at least 20 years, as required by the property's plan of action; and have the option to extend the contract to a 20-year term, if he or she has an existing multi-year project-based rental assistance contract for less than 20 years.   (Sec. 77002) Prohibits the LIHPRHA, or any plan of action or use agreement implementing it, from restricting an owner from obtaining a new loan or refinancing an existing loan secured by a low-income housing project, or from distributing the proceeds of such a loan, except that, in conjunction with such refinancing:  the owner shall provide for adequate rehabilitation pursuant to a capital needs assessment to ensure long-term sustainability of the property satisfactory to the lender or bond issuance agency; any resulting budget-based rent increase shall include debt service on the new financing, commercially reasonable debt service coverage, and replacement reserves as required by the lender; and any rent increases resulting from the refinancing transaction for units not covered by a project-based rental subsidy contract shall be limited to 10%, with the following exception.  Prohibits requiring any tenant who occupies a dwelling unit as of the time of the refinancing, and gives the owner proof of income, to pay for rent and utilities, for the duration of the tenancy, any amount exceeding the greater of: (1) 30% of the tenant's income, or (2) the amount the tenant paid for rent and utilities immediately before the refinancing.  (Sec. 77003) Directs HUD to issue any guidance necessary to carry out this Act within 120 days after its enactment. TITLE LXXVIII--TENANT INCOME VERIFICATION RELIEF (Sec. 78001) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to annual review of low-income families' income for eligibility requirements for certain federal assisted housing programs.  Declares that, after the initial review of any family's fix income, a public housing agency (PHA) or owner may not be required to review its income for any year for which the family certifies, in accordance with specified requirements as HUD shall establish.  Requires the PHA or the owner to review each such family's income at least once every three years.  Requires PHAs also to review the income of a family receiving Section 8 (rental assistance voucher program) assistance at least once every three years (currently, at least annually). TITLE LXXIX--HOUSING ASSISTANCE EFFICIENCY (Sec. 79001) Amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to allow (in addition to a state, local government, or public housing agency) a private nonprofit organization to administer permanent housing rental assistance provided through the Continuum of Care Program under the Act.  (Sec. 79002) Requires HUD, at least once (currently, twice) during each fiscal year, to reallocate any housing assistance provided from the Emergency Solutions Grants Program that is unused or returned or that becomes available after the minimum allocation requirements under the Act. TITLE LXXX--CHILD SUPPORT ASSISTANCE (Sec. 80001) Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with respect to the permissible purposes of consumer reports, to authorize a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report in response to a request by the head of a state or local child support enforcement agency (or an authorized state or local government official), if the requester certifies that the report is needed for enforcing a child support order, award, agreement, or judgment.  Repeals the requirement for 10 days' prior notice to a consumer whose report is requested. TITLE LXXXI--PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING (Sec. 81001) Directs HUD to establish a demonstration program under which, in FY2016 through FY2019, it may execute budget-neutral, performance-based agreements (for up to 12 years each) that result in a reduction in energy or water costs with appropriate entities to carry out projects for energy or water conservation improvements at up to 20,000 residential units in multifamily buildings participating in:  Section 8 project-based rental assistance programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937, other than Section 8 (voucher program) assistance; supportive housing for the elderly programs under the Housing Act of 1959; or supportive housing for persons with disabilities programs under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.  Prescribes requirements for payment under an agreement, which shall be contingent on documented utility savings, as well as for agreement terms, eligibility, geographical diversity, and funding for the program.  Limits this demonstration program to properties subject to affordability restrictions, which may be through an affordability agreement under a new housing assistance payments contract with HUD, or through an enforceable covenant with the property owner, for at least 15 years after completion of any conservation improvements made under the program. Requires HUD to submit to specified congressional committees a detailed plan for the implementation of this Act.  Authorizes HUD, for each fiscal year during which an agreement is in effect, to use any appropriated funds for the renewal of contracts under the program. TITLE LXXXII--CAPITAL ACCESS FOR SMALL COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (Sec. 82001) Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.   Declares that a credit union which lacks federal deposit insurance and has applied for membership in a federal home loan bank may be treated as meeting all the eligibility requirements for federal deposit insurance if the supervisor of the chartering state has determined that it meets all federal deposit insurance eligibility requirements. Deems such a credit union to have met the eligibility criteria for federal home loan bank membership if, six months after its application date, the state supervisor has failed to act upon the application. Declares that no state law authorizing a conservator or liquidating agent of a credit union to repudiate contracts may apply to any: (1) extension of credit from a federal home loan bank to a credit union which is a member of that bank, or (2) security interest in the assets of the credit union securing such extension of credit.  Declares that if a federal home loan bank makes an advance to a state-chartered credit union that is not federally insured:  the bank's interest in any collateral securing that advance has the same priority and is afforded the same standing and rights that the security interest would have had if the advance had been made to a federally-insured credit union, and the bank has the same right to access such collateral that it would have had if the advance had been made to a federally-insured credit union.   Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require private deposit insurers of credit unions that are members of a federal home loan bank to submit copies of their audit reports within seven days to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  (Sec. 82002) Directs the Government Accountability Office to study: (1) the adequacy of insurance reserves held by a private deposit insurer that insures deposits in an insured credit union or any credit union eligible to apply to become one, and (2) such credit unions' compliance with federal regulations governing disclosure of a lack of federal deposit insurance. TITLE LXXXIII--SMALL BANK EXAM CYCLE REFORM (Sec. 83001) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $500 million to $1 billion the asset size of small insured depository institutions eligible for 18-month on-site examination cycles.  Qualifies such an institution also for the 18-month cycle if its total assets are at most $200 million (currently $100 million) and the most recent examination found its composite condition to be good rather than outstanding. Grants a federal banking agency discretion to increase this assets ceiling amount from $200 million to $1 billion (currently from $100 million to $500 million) if that greater asset size would be consistent with the principles of safety and soundness. TITLE LXXXIV--SMALL COMPANY SIMPLE REGISTRATION (Sec. 84001) Directs the SEC to revise Form S-1 so that a smaller reporting company may incorporate by reference in a registration statement filed on that form any documents it files with the SEC after the registration statement's effective date. TITLE LXXXV--HOLDING COMPANY REGISTRATION THRESHOLD EQUALIZATION  (Sec. 85001) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require an issuer that is a savings and loan holding company to register with the SEC if: (1) its assets exceed $10 million, and (2) it has a class of equity security held of record by 2,000 or more persons. Requires this registration to be terminated after a savings and loan holding company certifies that its holders of record of that class of security have been reduced to fewer than 1,200 persons. Declares that the duty of a savings and loan holding company to file supplementary and periodic information shall be suspended automatically if the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates (other than any class of asset-backed securities) are held of record by fewer than 1,200 persons. TITLE LXXXVI--REPEAL OF INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (Sec. 86001) Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to repeal the requirement that specified entities agree to indemnify the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for any expenses arising from litigation relating to certain information about swaps cleared by derivatives clearing organizations which is shared with the entities before the CFTC may share the information with them. Repeals a similar requirement for the same entities with which a swap data repository may share swap data to agree to indemnify the repository and the CFTC for any expenses arising from similar litigation. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to repeal a similar requirement for the same entities (plus the CFTC) with which a securities-based swap data repository may share securities-based swap data to agree to indemnify the repository and the SEC for any expenses arising from similar litigation. Makes these repeals take effect retroactively to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. TITLE LXXXVII--TREATMENT OF DEBT OR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF SMALLER INSTITUTIONS (Sec. 87001) Amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010 with respect to the date for determining the consolidated assets of smaller depository institution holding companies supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  Exempts from otherwise required capital deductions, pursuant to mandatory minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, any debt or equity instruments issued before May 19, 2010, by depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of March 31, 2010 (currently as of December 31, 2009). TITLE LXXXVIII--STATE LICENSING EFFICIENCY State Licensing Efficiency Act of 2015 (Sec. 88002) Amends the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to require the Attorney General to give access to all criminal history information to state officials responsible for regulating, not only state-licensed loan originators (as under current law), but also other financial service providers, to the extent such checks are required under the laws of the state for the licensing of such other financial service providers. TITLE LXXXIX--HELPING EXPAND LENDING PRACTICES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES Helping Expand Lending Practices in Rural Communities Act of 2015 or the HELP Rural Communities Act of 2015 (Sec. 89002) Directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish an application process under which a person who lives or does business in a state may apply to have the CFPB identify as rural an area it has not already so identified. Specifies factors for the CFPB to take into consideration when evaluating such an application. Permits the CFPB to disregard any designation of the area as nonrural by another federal agency. Subjects any application to 90 days of public comment. Requires the CFPB to make a decision on a designation application within 90 days after the end of the public comment period. (Sec. 89003) Amends the Truth in Lending Act to modify the requirements for a qualified mortgage or an escrow or impound account relating to certain consumer credit transactions secured by a first lien on the consumer's principal dwelling. Authorizes the CFPB to include as a qualified mortgage, with respect to the presumption that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay it, a balloon loan extended by any creditor that operates in rural or underserved areas, whether predominantly or not. (Currently the creditor must operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.) Authorizes the CFPB also to exempt a creditor, in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, from the requirement to establish an escrow or impound account for the consumer if the creditor operates in rural or underserved areas, whether predominantly or not. (Currently the creditor must operate predominantly in such areas.)",
