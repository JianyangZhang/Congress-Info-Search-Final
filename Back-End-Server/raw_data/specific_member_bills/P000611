The bill permanently disqualifies individuals who have been found guilty of offenses or misconduct, including:    fraud or misrepresentation with respect to SNAP;  the trading of a controlled substance, firearms, ammunition, or explosives for benefits;   terrorism;   defrauding the federal government, a state, or a unit of local government;   obtaining cash by destroying food purchased with benefits and collecting deposits for containers; or   selling food purchased with benefits.   An individual who is delinquent in paying child support may not receive benefits unless a court allowed a payment delay or the individual is complying with a payment plan.  If a household requests a third replacement Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card in a one-year period, a state may: (1) require the head of the household to appear in person for an interview before issuing an additional card, and (2) terminate participation of the household for one year if a fifth card is requested in a one-year period.  The bill modifies the work requirements and eliminates certain exemptions and waivers from the requirements. If an able-bodied adult without dependents fails to meet the work requirements for 3 months in a 48-month period (36 months under current law), they are ineligible for SNAP for the remainder of the 48-month period, or until they comply.
