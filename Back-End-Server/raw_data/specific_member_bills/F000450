The bill amends UMRA to: (1) transfer certain responsibilities under it from the Office of Management and Budget to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA); (2) set forth detailed criteria to guide agencies in assessing the effects of federal regulatory actions on state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector; (3) revise requirements for agency statements accompanying significant regulatory actions to require an analysis of the effects of a proposed final rule on state, local, or tribal governments, the private sector, and private property owners; and (4) extend to the the private sector the requirement for consultation with agencies in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant federal mandates. UMRA reporting requirements are revised to require: (1) the OIRA to provide guidance and oversight so that agency regulations are consistent with the principles and policies of UMRA and do not conflict with the policies or actions of another agency; and (2) agencies to include in their annual compliance statements an appendix detailing consultation activities with state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. The bill requires an agency, at the request of the chairman or ranking member of a standing or select House or Senate Committee, to conduct a retrospective analysis of an existing regulation promulgated by such agency.  Judicial review under UMRA is expanded to include review of provisions of such Act relating to agency assessment of the effects of the regulatory process and agency selection of the least costly or least burdensome alternative to a regulatory mandate. Courts are granted expanded powers to compel agencies to comply with UMRA reporting requirements.",

(Sec. 3) The bill directs ED to develop, annually update, and make publicly available a College Dashboard website to replace the College Navigator website.  It revises the consumer information ED must make publicly available regarding an institution that participates in federal student aid programs under title IV (Student Assistance). ED must also publish and link to the College Dashboard website additional information regarding student enrollment, completion rates, costs, use of financial aid, and faculty. The bill establishes certain minimum requirements for an institution's net price calculator, including website location and information provided.
