The Department of Defense (DOD) shall designate a DOD official to be Principal Defense Space Advisor on all space matters.  DOD shall:  develop and implement a strategy to increase interoperability across DOD space and cyberspace enterprises between systems that electronically share cyberspace situational awareness and space situational awareness data, and  assess desirable protection capabilities to enhance integration of commercial space systems into national security space architectures.  The President shall establish a National Executive Committee on Weather. DOD shall:  develop a follow-on geomagnetic storm warning capability,  carry out a pilot program to assess the potential viability of using commercial weather data in DOD weather modeling and forecasting, and  establish a program to award up to four launch services contracts for venture-class launch missions.    The Air Force shall contract with a private entity to carry out Satellite Control Network operations.  The bill requires U.S. aeronautical and space activities to contribute materially to:   the expansion of the human sphere of influence throughout the Solar System, being among the first to arrive at a destination in space and open it for subsequent use and development, and  creation of infrastructure precursors to support future use and development of space.   The bill establishes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Leadership and Advising Commission. NASA shall develop:  a 20-year plan that outlines broad goals, including a designated five-year range for American astronauts to land on Mars; a 10-year plan that in part addresses the efficacy of the Asteroid Redirect Mission; multi-year budgets beginning in FY2018.     NASA shall:  formulate a plan for the remaining life of the International Space Station and continued human presence in low-Earth orbit, and establish a Commercial Habitat Pilot Program to demonstrate the viability of using commercially built on-orbit habitats to meet NASA human exploration and science missions.    The bill establishes an Office of Commercial Space Transportation within the Department of Transportation (DOT), which shall in turn establish within it an Office of Spaceports to support and establish domestic commercial spaceports. DOT shall also designate a lead government agency for space traffic management activities and services. The Department of State shall seek to convene a meeting of nations to develop a unified space traffic management regime.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce shall promulgate rules regarding its treatment of weather data acquired from commercial space-based systems.  Commerce shall report on the feasibility and benefits of reorganizing the Department to better coordinate and support its space-related economic and regulatory activities.     The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for 10% of the insured value of all payloads launched by a licensed domestic launch provider or on a launch vehicle meeting Buy American requirements Commerce shall make loan guarantees to a domestic commercial entity or a Federal Aviation Administation-licensed spaceport to promote job creation in the U.S. space sector and encourage startup companies. DOT shall establish a program to allow commercial entities to operate space training flights.   The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow an individual to elect to include in gross income gains from the sale or other disposal of stock or option-related compensation received for services rendered from a startup domestic commercial space company.",

Expresses the sense of Congress that at least 30% of the funds authorized for R&amp;D at OAR by this Act should be made available for this purpose.   (Sec. 4) Requires the Under Secretary, in collaboration with the American weather industry and academic partners, to establish a tornado warning improvement and extension program, with the goal of reducing the loss of life and economic losses from tornadoes through the development and extension of accurate, effective, and timely tornado forecasts, predictions, and warnings, including the prediction of tornadoes beyond one hour in advance.  Requires the Assistant Administrator for the OAR to develop a program plan detailing the research, development, and technology transfer activities, as well as corresponding resources and timelines, necessary to achieve the program goal.  (Sec. 5) Directs the Under Secretary, in collaboration with the American weather industry and academic partners, to establish a hurricane warning improvement program, with the goal of developing and extending accurate hurricane forecasts and warnings.  Requires the OAR Assistant Administrator to develop a program plan detailing the research, development, and technology transfer activities, as well as corresponding resources and timelines, necessary to achieve such program's goal.  (Sec. 6) Requires the Assistant Administrator for the OAR, in coordination with the Assistant Administrators for the NWS and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), to issue a plan for restoring U.S. leadership in numerical weather prediction, and forecasting that: (1) describes the forecasting skill and technology goals, objectives, and progress of NOAA in carrying out the weather research and forecasting innovation program; (2) identifies and prioritizes R&amp;D activities, and performance metrics, weighted to meet the operational NWS weather mission; (3) describes how the program will collaborate with stakeholders; and (4) identifies research necessary to enhance the integration of social science knowledge into weather forecast and warning processes.  (Sec. 7) Requires the Under Secretary to: (1) develop a prioritized list of observation data requirements necessary to ensure weather forecasting capabilities to protect life and property; (2) use Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), Observing System Experiments (OSEs), Analyses of Alternatives (AOAs), and other appropriate assessment tools to undertake ongoing systematic evaluations of observing systems, data, and information needed to meet the requirements listed; (3) identify current and potential future data gaps in observing capabilities related to such requirements; and (4) determine a range of options to address the gaps identified.  (Sec. 8) Directs the Assistant Administrator for the OAR to undertake OSSEs to assess the relative value and benefits of observing capabilities and systems. Allows technical and scientific OSSE evaluations to include assessments of the impact of observing capabilities on: (1) global weather prediction, (2) hurricane track and intensity forecasting, (3) tornado warning lead times and accuracy, (4) prediction of mid-latitude severe local storm outbreaks; and (5) prediction of storms that have the potential to cause extreme precipitation and flooding lasting from six hours to one week. Requires such evaluations to be conducted in cooperation with other appropriate entities within NOAA, other federal agencies, the American weather industry, and academic partners to ensure the technical and scientific merit of OSSE results.  Requires OSSEs to: (1) determine the potential impact of proposed space-based, sub-orbital, and in-situ observing systems on analyses and forecasts, including potential impacts on extreme weather events across all parts of the nation; (2) evaluate and compare observing system design options; and (3) assess the relative capabilities and costs of various and combinations of observing systems in providing data necessary for the protection of life and property. Requires OSSEs to be conducted: (1) before the acquisition of major government-owned or government-leased operational observing systems, including polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite systems, with a lifecycle cost of more than $500 million; and (2) before the purchase of any major new commercially provided data with a lifecycle cost of more than $500 million.  Requires the Assistant Administrator for the OAR, by June 30, 2014, to: (1) complete OSSEs to assess the value of data from both global Positioning System radio occultation and a geostationary hyperspectral sounder global constellation, and (2) publish the results.  (Sec. 9) Requires the NOAA Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for OAR and the Assistant Administrator for NWS, to produce and make publicly available a report explaining how NOAA intends to: (1) pursue the newest, fastest, and most cost-effective high performance computing technologies in support of its weather prediction mission; (2) ensure a balance between the research requirements to develop the next generation of regional and global models and its highly reliable operational models; (3) take advantage of advanced development concepts to make its next generation weather prediction models available in beta-test mode to its operational forecasters, the American weather industry, and its partners in academic and government research; (4) identify opportunities to reallocate existing advanced computing resources from lower priority uses to improve advanced research and operational weather prediction; and (5) harness new computing power in the OAR and NWS for immediate improvement in forecasting and experimentation.  (Sec. 10) Declares that the prohibition against the lease, sale, or transfer to the private sector, or the commercialization of, any part of the weather satellite systems operated by the Department of Commerce or any successor agency shall not extend to: (1) the purchase of weather data through contracts with commercial providers, or (2) the placement of weather satellite instruments on co-hosted government or private payloads.  Directs the Secretary of Commerce to transmit to Congress a strategy to enable the procurement of quality commercial weather data. Requires such strategy to: (1) assess the range and expected cost-effectiveness of commercial opportunities, including public-private partnerships, for obtaining both surface-based and space-based weather observations; and (2) make a plan for procuring data, including an expected implementation timeline, from such nongovernmental sources, as appropriate.  (Sec. 11) Directs the Under Secretary to establish a Federal Advisory Committee to: (1) advise about prioritizing weather research initiatives at NOAA to produce real improvement in weather forecasting; (2) review and comment on existing or emerging technologies or techniques that can be found in private industry or the research community that could be incorporated into forecasting at the NWS to improve forecasting; (3) identify opportunities to improve communications between weather forecasters, emergency management personnel, and the public; and (4) address any other matters that would improve innovation in weather forecasting.  Prohibits the Under Secretary from appointing a majority of the 12 members of the Advisory Committee from among employees of NOAA-funded research centers. (Sec. 12) Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to establish an Inter-agency Committee for Advancing Weather Services to improve the coordination of relevant weather research and forecast innovation activities across the federal government.  Requires such Committee to: (1) include participation by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NOAA and its constituent elements, the NSF, and other appropriate agencies involved in weather forecasting research; (2) identify and prioritize top forecast needs and coordinate them against budget requests and program initiatives across participating offices and agencies; and (3) share information regarding operational needs and forecasting improvements across relevant agencies.  Requires the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology to serve as a co-chair of such panel.  (Sec. 13) Authorizes the Assistant Administrator for the OAR and the Assistant Administrator for NWS to establish a program for detailing OAR personnel to the NWS and NWS personnel to OAR to enhance forecasting innovation through regular, direct interaction between OAR scientists and NWS operational staff.  Requires the program to allow up to 10 OAR staff and NWS staff to spend up to a year on detail.  (Sec. 14) Authorizes the Assistant Administrator for NWS to establish a program to host competitively selected postdoctoral fellows and academic researchers for a year at any of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction to provide direct interaction between forecasters and academic and private sector researchers in an effort to bring innovation to forecasting tools and techniques available to the NWS.  (Sec. 16) Authorizes appropriations through FY2017, as well as alternative funding amounts for FY2014 if the Budget Control Act of 2011 is repealed or replaced with an Act increasing allocations.  Prohibits any additional funds from being authorized to carry out this Act and the amendments made by it. ",

Establishes the discretionary spending limit for the revised security category for each such fiscal year. Amends part B (Supplemental Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to adjustments to the calculation of Medicare parts B and D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) premiums for high income beneficiaries for 2017 and subsequent years. Reduces the monthly amount of the Medicare parts B and D premium subsidies (with a corresponding increase in the monthly premium amount) for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount by specified applicable percentages for modified adjusted gross incomes in certain ranges starting at $85,000 (40%) and finally exceeding $214,000 (90%). Revises the temporary adjustment to income thresholds used to calculate premiums between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019, to extend it through December 31 of the first year after 2019 after the year in which at least 25% of individuals enrolled in the Medicare parts B and D are subject to a reduction to the monthly amount of the applicable premium subsidy. Increases by $25 per year the part B deductible for new enrollees after January 1, 2017, and subsequent years. Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to establish caps beginning with FY2014 for: (1) combined crop insurance provider rates of return, and (2) reimbursements for crop insurance provider administrative and operating expenses.
