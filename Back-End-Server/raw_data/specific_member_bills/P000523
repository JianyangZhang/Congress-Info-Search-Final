States may not issue permits, pursuant to any federal law, to a swine farm that is a concentrated animal feeding operation unless the farm disposes of swine waste using a certified technology.  The bill amends several agricultural laws to:   require USDA to make competitive grants for activities to identify, evaluate, and demonstrate environmentally superior swine waste management technologies;   permit the Pork Promotion Board to use its funding for activities related to the grants; and  make the installation and maintenance of a certified technology on a swine farm eligible for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program.

The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to require the disclosure of any independent expenditure and electioneering communication equal to or greater than $1,000. Stop Super PAC-Candidate Coordination Act The bill amends FECA to treat payments for coordinated expenditures as contributions to candidates under certain conditions, and set forth rules for coordinated expenditures. The bill also prohibits candidates, individual federal officeholders, agents of a candidate or an individual federal officeholder, or certain related entities from soliciting, receiving, directing, or transferring funds to or on behalf of any political committee which accepts donations or contributions that do not comply with FECA limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements, or to or on behalf of any political organization which accepts such donations or contributions. Real Time Transparency Act The bill amends FECA to require 48-hour notification to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by all political committees receiving cumulative contributions (instead of single contributions) of $1,000 or more during a year from any contributor. Federal Election Administration Act of 2016 FECA is also amended to replace the FEC with the Federal Election Administration (FEA). The Government Accountability Office shall: (1) examine the enforcement of the criminal provisions of FECA and prohibitions regarding the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account, and (2) study the adequate level of resources for the FEA to execute competently the responsibilities imposed by this bill.  The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to revise the definition of lobbyist to mean any individual who is employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation for services that include more than one lobbying contact over a two-year (currently three-month) period. Financial Services Conflict of Interest Act The federal criminal code is amended regarding application of certain conflict-of-interest restrictions to a private sector employer that makes payment of compensation contingent on accepting a position in the federal government. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is amended to prohibit a covered financial services regulator from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence a particular matter that provides a direct and substantial pecuniary benefit for a former employer or former client. The Office of Government Ethics must discharge certain record keeping duties to implement this bill. Violators of this bill shall be subject to specified criminal and civil penalties. The bill revises and extends certain restrictions on subsequent employment on current and former procurement officers. The federal criminal code is also amended to place specified time restrictions on subsequent employment for financial service regulators. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to revise restrictions on federal examiners and supervisors of financial institutions.",

Limits the total amount of payments to a presidential primary candidate to $300 million. Provides for an inflation adjustment to matching contributions beginning after 2015. Requires presidential primary candidates who opt to participate in the public financing system to certify to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that they have raised $25,000 (currently, $5,000) in each of 20 states, with individual contributions limited to $250. Requires such candidates to commit to accept public financing in both the primary and general elections. Prohibits presidential primary candidates or their authorized committees from accepting contributions or bundled contributions (i.e., combining small contributions into one large contribution) from lobbyists or political action committees (PACs). Eliminates expenditure limitations for presidential primary and general elections. Changes the period for payment of matching funds to presidential primary candidates from January 1 of the election year to six months prior to the date of the earliest state primary election. Revises financing provisions for general elections to: (1) limit individual contributions to participating candidates to $1,000; and (2) extend matching payments to general elections at a six-to-one rate for contributions of $250 or less, to a maximum amount of $300 million in total matching payments to a publicly-financed general election candidate.
