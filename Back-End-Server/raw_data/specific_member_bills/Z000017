DHS may provide, with specified exceptions, excess DHS nonlethal equipment and supplies (as well as related training) to a foreign government if that would:   further U.S. homeland security interests; and enhance the recipient government's capacity to mitigate the threat of terrorism, infectious disease or natural disaster, protect lawful trade and travel, or enforce intellectual property rights.  DHS shall:   notify Congress before providing such systems, equipment, or supplies; and  report to Congress annually through 2022 regarding foreign government efforts to combat terrorist and foreign fighter travel.
