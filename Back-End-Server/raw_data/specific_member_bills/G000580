DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish an Acquisition Review Board to strengthen accountability and uniformity within the DHS acquisition review process, review major acquisition programs (programs estimated to require a total expenditure of at least $300 million over their life cycle costs), and review the use of best practices. The board shall convene at DHS's discretion and whenever: (1) a major acquisition program requires authorization to proceed from one acquisition decision event to another, is in breach of its approved requirements, or requires additional review; or (2) a non-major acquisition program requires review. The board's responsibilities are to:  determine whether a proposed acquisition has met the requirements of key phases of the acquisition life cycle framework and is able to proceed to the next phase and eventual full production and deployment;  oversee whether a proposed acquisition's business strategy, resources, management, and accountability is executable and aligned to strategic initiatives;  support the acquisition decision authority in determining the appropriate direction at key acquisition decision events;  conduct systematic reviews to ensure that acquisitions are progressing in compliance with the approved documents for their current acquisition phases;  review the acquisition documents of each major acquisition program to ensure the reliability of underlying data; and  ensure that practices are implemented to require consideration of tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance objectives as part of the process for developing requirements for major acquisition programs prior to initiating the second acquisition decision event.  If the person exercising acquisition decision authority over a major acquisition program approves such program to proceed into the planning phase before such program has a DHS-approved acquisition program baseline, DHS shall: (1) create and approve a baseline report regarding such approval; (2) notify Congress within 7 days after an acquisition decision memorandum is signed; and (3) within 60 days after such signing, report on the rationale for such decision and a plan of action to require an acquisition program baseline for such program. DHS shall report annually to specified congressional committees through FY2022 on the board's activities, including information on:  any acquisition decision memoranda for each meeting of the board, results of the systematic reviews, results of acquisition document reviews, and  activities to ensure that practices are adopted and implemented throughout DHS regarding such tradeoffs.

DC is denied authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms for legitimate purposes.  The bill: (1) amends the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (FCRA) to repeal DC's registration requirement for possession of firearms, and (2) maintains the current ban on the possession and control of a sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, or short-barreled rifle.  This bill prohibits dealing, importing, or manufacturing firearms without complying with federal law requirements. In the case of a sale or transfer of a handgun to a DC resident, a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of firearms in Maryland or Virginia shall be treated as a dealer licensed in DC if certain requirements are met. The bill prohibits selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of any firearm or ammunition to any person if the sellers or transferors know that such person is prohibited by federal law from possessing or receiving it. Individuals prohibited from possessing a firearm by federal law are barred from possessing a firearm in DC. The bill repeals specified DC policies and requirements regarding the keeping or storing of firearms and eliminates criminal penalties for possession of unregistered firearms. The bill amends the District of Columbia Code to: (1) allow DC property owners to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on their property, (2) authorize certain individuals to carry firearms in certain places and for certain purposes, (3) prescribe requirements for lawful transportation of firearms, and (4) prohibit the use of toy and antique pistols to commit a violent or dangerous crime. DC is authorized to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms, except to certain lessees, within any building or structure under its control that has implemented security measures to identify and exclude unauthorized or hazardous persons or articles. The DC Chief of Police shall issue a five-year license to carry a concealed pistol to any qualified individual who completes the application process. The bill: (1) repeals FCRA requirements that a gun offender register and verify certain identifiable information with the Chief; and (2) repeals specified DC statutes in order to conform with this bill and restores any provision of law amended or repealed by such statutes as if they had not been enacted into law.",
