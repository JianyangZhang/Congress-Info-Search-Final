The bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations. Treasury must prohibit a U.S.-based financial institution from knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with a covered person. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations. The bill amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the United States to oppose international financial assistance for a foreign government that does not implement these sanctions against North Korea. The President may waive this directive after specified steps are taken. The bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act to prohibit the bank from providing support to a covered person. Treasury must report on compliance with this bill among financial institutions, including any penalties imposed and efforts by Treasury to support compliance. The bill amends the International Financial Institutions Act to require Treasury to: (1) instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the use of the IMF's administrative budget for technical assistance that strengthens the capacity of IMF members to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and (2) report on the effectiveness of such assistance. The President may suspend or terminate sanctions under this bill if certain steps regarding nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are taken by North Korea. ",

The bill prescribes characteristics of a qualified collateralized loan obligation with respect to:    asset quality protections that have at least 100% of the obligation's assets composed of senior secured loans and cash equivalents,  asset portfolio protections,   structural protections,  alignment of manager and investor interests,  regulatory oversight requirements, and   transparency and disclosure requirements.   Further criteria for the asset quality protections for a qualified collaterilized loan obligation require that the obligation:   have 100% of its loan assets issued by companies; have no assets that are asset-backed securities or derivatives (except for an acquired loan participation, any interest related to or in a letter of credit, or a derivative transaction to hedge interest rate or currency rate mismatches); not purchase assets in default, margin stock, or equity convertible securities; acquire only loans held or acquired by three or more investors or lenders unaffiliated with the manager; hold only loans to borrowers whose financial statements are subject to an annual audit from an independent, accredited accounting firm; and  have no more than 60% of its assets composed of covenant lite loans, except that each asset shall require disclosure of unaudited quarterly financial statements and of audited annual financial statements.  A \"covenant lite loan\" (or \"cov-lite,\" commonly a loan agreement that does not contain the usual protective covenants for the benefit of the lending party) shall mean in this bill, at the time a collateralized loan obligation enters into a commitment to acquire it, a loan for which the underlying instruments neither:   require the obligor to comply with any maintenance covenant; nor contain a cross-default provision to a financing facility of the obligor that requires the obligor to comply with a maintenance covenant (including one that may apply only upon the funding of such other loan or financing facility).  If any such loan is pari passu (treated equally and without preference) with another loan of the obligor that would not be a covenant lite loan, such loan shall be deemed not to be a covenant lite loan.",
