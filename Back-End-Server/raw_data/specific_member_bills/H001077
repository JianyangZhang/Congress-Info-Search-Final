(Sec. 3) The DHS Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation shall oversee the costs of acquisition programs and related activities to ensure that actual and planned costs are in accordance with budget estimates and are affordable, or can be adequately funded, over the life cycle of such programs and activities.  (Sec. 4) The DHS Chief Information Officer shall: (1) oversee the management of the Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture, (2) make recommendations to the Acquisition Review Board regarding information technology programs, and (3) be responsible for developing information technology acquisition strategic guidance.
