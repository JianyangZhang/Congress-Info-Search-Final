(Sec. 4) It shall be U.S. policy to: (1) combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs, (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation systems with effective enforcement mechanisms, and (3) promote the dignity and security of human life.

(Sec. 6) The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to define \"trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs\" as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of a person, either living or dead, for the purpose of removing one or more of the person's organs by:   coercion,  abduction,  deception,  fraud,  abuse of power, or   transfer of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of an individual having control over such person for the purpose of removing the person's organs.   \"Organ\" means the human (including fetal) kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone, and skin or any subpart thereof and any other human organ specified by the Department of Health and Human Services.  Trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs is included in the definition of \"severe forms of trafficking in persons.\"  The Interagency Task Force To Monitor and Combat Trafficking is tasked with collecting and organizing data from human rights officers at U.S. embassies on host country's laws against trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs and any instances of violations of such laws. (Sec. 7) The State Department shall report annually through 2024 to Congress regarding: (1) the trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs, and (2) preventive activities undertaken by the State Department and other countries.

(Sec. 3) The bill adds \"Subchapter V - Liquidation, Reorganization, or Recapitalization of a Covered Financial Corporation,\" setting forth requirements and prohibitions regarding: (1) commencement of a case concerning a covered financial corporation; (2) a special trustee and bridge company; (3) special transfer of the property of the estate in bankruptcy; (4) treatment of qualified financial contracts and affiliate contracts; (5) licenses, permits, and registrations; (6) exemption from securities laws; and (7) inapplicability of certain avoiding powers. A debtor holding company may transfer the assets (including executory contracts and unexpired leases) of a covered financial corporation, including the equity in all of its operating subsidiaries, to a newly-formed bridge company over a single weekend, during which a 48-hour stay of debt-collection proceedings (except payment and delivery obligations) shall apply.  The bill permits conversion to chapter 7 (Liquidation) of a case under subchapter V if certain conditions are met. The Bankruptcy Court may not order an assets transfer unless it determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a transfer is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. (Sec. 4) The judicial code is amended to require the Chief Justice of the United States to designate at least 10 bankruptcy judges to be available to hear a Subchapter V case in bankruptcy.
