(Sec. 4) The OMB must issue guidance on improving information sharing by government agencies, including by:  requiring relevant officials to identify and communicate information about high-risk activities;  requiring appropriate agency officials to review the reports issued by charge card-issuing banks on questionable transaction activity and suspicious timing or amounts of cash withdrawals or advances;  providing for the appropriate sharing of information related to potential questionable transactions, fraud schemes, and high risk activities with GSA and appropriate federal officials; and  considering the recommendations made by Inspectors General or the best practices Inspectors General have identified.  (Sec. 5) The GSA and the OMB must establish a purchase and travel charge card data management group to develop and share best practices. (Sec. 6) The GSA shall report on: (1) the implementation of this bill, including the metrics used in determining whether the analytic and benchmarking efforts have reduced, or contributed to the reduction of, questionable or improper payments, as well as improved utilization of card-based payment products; and (2) further potential savings opportunities for government agencies under the federal charge card programs.

                "summary": "Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of  2016 (Sec. 3) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement an intrusion assessment plan to identify and remove intruders in federal agency information systems.  DHS must deploy and operate, for use by other agencies, capabilities to detect and prevent or remove cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting or traveling to or from agency information systems. DHS may access, and agencies may disclose to DHS, information transiting agency systems, regardless of the location from which the information is accessed, notwithstanding any laws that would otherwise restrict or prevent such disclosures. Agencies must utilize such capabilities and adopt subsequent improvements. DHS must establish a pilot to test and deploy advanced technologies to improve detection and prevention.  DHS must ensure that: (1) activities are reasonably necessary to protect agency information and systems from cybersecurity risks, (2) information accessed by DHS will be retained no longer than reasonably necessary, (3) notice has been provided to users of agency information systems concerning access to their communications, and (4) activities are implemented pursuant to policies governing the operation of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities.  Liability protections are provided to private entities authorized to assist DHS with such capabilities. But such liability protections shall not be construed to authorize an Internet service provider to break a user agreement with a customer. The Department of Justice must ensure that guidelines for such capabilities are consistent with laws governing the acquisition, interception, retention, use, and disclosure of communications. The OMB and DHS must update government-wide policies and brief Congress regarding the prioritization and use of network security monitoring tools within agency networks. The Department of Defense and the intelligence community are exempt from this bill's procedures. (Sec. 4) DHS must include in the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Program advanced network security tools to improve visibility of network activity to detect and mitigate intrusions and anomalous activity. The OMB must implement a plan to ensure that agencies utilize such advanced tools.  DHS must collaborate with the OMB to update government information security metrics to include measures of intrusion and incident detection and response times. The OMB must display additional agency metrics on federal government performance websites.  Upon an agency's request, DHS may operate and maintain technology that is deployed to agencies to diagnose and mitigate against cyber threats and vulnerabilities. (Sec. 5) DHS must require implementation of best practices for securing agency information systems against intrusion and preventing data exfiltration in the event of an intrusion. Agencies must: (1) identify their stored sensitive and mission critical data, (2) assess data access controls, (3) encrypt data consistent with federal information system standards, (4) implement a single sign-on trusted identity platform for individuals accessing each public website of the agency that requires user authentication, and (5) implement multifactor authentication for remote access to agency systems and for user accounts with elevated privileges. (Sec. 6) The Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of the federal government's strategy to secure agency information systems. On an annual basis: (1) DHS must report on the implementation status of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, and (2) the OMB must report on agency application of such capabilities. The OMB must submit updated intrusion assessment plans to Congress and report annually on intrusion assessment findings, advanced network security tools, and agency compliance. (Sec. 7) The authority for operating such federal intrusion detection and prevention capabilities terminates seven years after enactment of this bill.  (Sec. 8) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) must submit to Congress an assessment of: (1) the risks that would result from the breach of unclassified information systems that provide access to information that, when combined with other unclassified information, may comprise classified information; and (2) the cost and impact on the mission carried out by each agency if such systems were subsequently classified. (Sec. 9) DHS and the ODNI must coordinate with agencies to conduct an ongoing damage and risk assessment relating to data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The ODNI must report on: (1) the extent to which federal data was compromised, exfiltrated, or manipulated by the same entity that caused the OPM data breach; (2) national security impacts; and (3) whether information accessed through the breach has been released or deployed. (Sec. 10) DHS may issue an emergency directive to an agency to take any lawful action regarding the operation of the agency's information system (including systems owned or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency) in response to a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or incident that represents a substantial threat to information security. DHS must report annually to Congress regarding specific actions taken pursuant to such directives.  If DHS determines that there is an imminent threat for which a directive is unlikely to result in a timely response, DHS may authorize the use of protective capabilities under DHS control for communications or system traffic transiting to or from, or stored on, an agency information system without prior consultation with the affected agency. But DHS must immediately notify the OMB, each affected agency, and Congress of the use of such imminent threat authority and the reasons for, and duration of, the action.  DHS may direct or authorize such lawful action or protective capability only: (1) to protect agency information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction; or (2) to require the remediation of, or to protect against, identified information security risks for information collected or maintained by or on behalf of an agency or that portion of an information system used or operated by an agency or other organization on an agency's behalf. The OMB must report annually regarding specific actions it has taken to enforce agency compliance and accountability.",

                "summary": "Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016  (Sec. 3) This bill directs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to identify annually a list of postal properties with space available for use by federal agencies and submit such list to specified congressional committees by September 30. This list shall also be provided to each federal agency for review and for making recommendations for collocations.  The bill establishes a Federal Property Council to be chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) develop guidance and ensure implementation of an efficient and effective property management strategy, (2) identify opportunities for the federal government to better manage its property and assets, and (3) reduce the costs of managing federal properties.  The council must update annually a property management plan template with government-wide performance measures to reduce surplus property, achieve better utilization of underutilized property, or enhance management of high value personal property. The evaluation criteria must: (1) enable Congress and federal agencies to track their progress on a government-wide basis, and (2) allow for comparison of the performance of federal agencies against industry and other public sector agencies. The council must develop: (1) utilization rates consistent throughout each category of space and consistent with nongovernmental space use rates, (2) a strategy to reduce the reliance of federal agencies on leased space for long-term needs if ownership would be less costly, (3) a list of field offices suitable for collocation, (4) guidelines for the use of public-private partnerships in the management of federal property, and (5) recommendations to improve accountability in the disposal of surplus property under the State Agencies for Surplus Property program. For five years, the council must report annually to the OMB on: (1) a list of the remaining excess or surplus property that is real property and of underutilized properties of each federal agency; (2) the council's progress in developing guidelines for agencies to assess their properties; (3) the progress of agencies in reducing excess and underutilized property; and (4) legislative recommendations.  The council must consult with: (1) state, local, and tribal authorities; (2) affected communities; and (3) private sector and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in transportation, commercial real estate, historic preservation, and homeless housing. The General Services Administration (GSA) must establish, and make publicly available on its website, a database of all real property under the custody and control of all federal agencies, including a list of property disposals.  Federal agencies with independent leasing authority shall annually submit to the council a list of all leases currently in effect. This requirement shall not apply to the USPS or any other property excluded for national security reasons.  (Sec. 4) The USPS shall: (1) maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for postal properties, (2) develop workforce projections to assess the property-related needs of the USPS workforce, and (3) conduct on a regular basis an inventory of postal property that is real property and make an assessment of the condition of each postal property.  The USPS may develop a five-year management template to: (1) reduce excess and underutilized property; (2) adopt workplace practices, configurations, and management techniques that decrease the need for real property assets; (3) identify leased space that is not fully used or occupied; and (4) secure mail processing operations.  (Sec. 5) Net proceeds of a sale of excess federal real property must be returned to the agency that had custody and accountability for such property. An agency may use such proceeds for: (1) continuing disposal of excess properties, and (2) activities under the Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010. Any net proceeds not expended by the agency must be used for deficit reduction.  (Sec. 6) The USPS inspector general must report on excess property held by the USPS and recommendations for repurposing such property and increasing collocation with other federal agencies.  (Sec. 7) The Government Accountability Office must report on the feasibility of mail delivery vehicles being: (1) equipped for travel in rural areas and extreme weather conditions, and (2) integrated with collision-averting technology. The USPS must report on the replacement, modernization, and lifecycle plans of the USPS postal service vehicle fleet.  (Sec. 8) Museums must be open to the public on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, and must operate during normal business hours, to be eligible to receive surplus federal property that the GSA transfers to state agencies for distribution through donation within their states.  (Sec. 9) The bill expands the duties of federal agencies, with respect to the use of federal real property, to require: (1) workforce projections to assess the property-related requirements of the federal workforce, (2) the establishment of goals and priorities to reduce excess and underutilized property, (3) assessments of leased space to identify space that is not fully used or occupied, and (4) an annual inventory of real property under agency control and an assessment of the condition of such property.
