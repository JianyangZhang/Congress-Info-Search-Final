The NSF must work with the Office of Personnel Management to: (1) consolidate information about cyber scholarships programs and job opportunities into a single online resource center; and (2) work with state, local, and tribal agencies to advertise cybersecurity positions to recipients.  The NSF may carry out a program to improve cybersecurity education at the K-12 level. The NSF may: (1) grant exceptions from the post-award employment obligations to students who agree to work in a critical infrastructure mission at a federal government corporation or a state, local, or tribal government-affiliated component of a critical infrastructure sector; or (2) develop a pilot program to enhance critical infrastructure protection training for students pursuing careers in cybersecurity.",

Urges:   all parties to the conflict to immediately halt indiscriminate attacks, the imposition of starvation sieges, and other forms of warfare directed against civilians and civilian infrastructure and to facilitate unfettered access to humanitarian assistance throughout Syria; all parties in Syria to support full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2268, which calls for a cessation of hostilities in the conflict, except with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and al Qaeda, to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance and reconstruction of war-affected communities; and the international community to continue to support neighboring countries and host communities who are supporting refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict.  Affirms: (1) the neutrality of medical professionals providing humanitarian assistance and health care on a non-political basis, (2) that the elimination of al Qaeda and ISIS safe havens in Syria is a vital U.S. national security interest, and (3) that the stability of key European and Middle Eastern partners is vital to U.S. national security and preventing the conflict from undermining that stability is a top U.S. priority. Commends the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Syrian Arab Coalition, and other local, Syrian partner forces for their support of Operation Inherent Resolve and the efforts of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. Calls upon the President to: (1) make it U.S. policy to continue to coordinate a comprehensive and generous response to the Syrian humanitarian crisis, (2) continue active U.S. participation in a diplomatic process to achieve a political agreement, and (3) submit a strategy for providing long-term stability and security in areas seized from ISIL.",
