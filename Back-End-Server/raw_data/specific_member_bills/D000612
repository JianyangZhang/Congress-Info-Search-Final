Those entities and owners may not allow direct contact between the public and the prohibited wildlife species. A person who knowingly violates the prohibition must be fined not more than $20,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. The bill considers each violation to be a separate offense. The offense must be deemed to have been committed not only in the district where the violation first occurred, but also in any district in which the defendant may have taken or been in possession of the prohibited wildlife species.

                "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on May 23, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (Sec. 4) This bill establishes the Public Buildings Reform Board to identify opportunities for the federal government to reduce significantly its inventory of civilian real property and reduce its costs.  (Sec. 10) The Board shall terminate six years after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 11) Each federal agency shall submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): (1) current data on all federal civilian real properties owned, leased, or controlled by each agency; (2) recommendations on such properties that can be disposed of or outleased or that otherwise no longer meet agency needs or that can be transferred, exchanged, consolidated, co-located, reconfigured, or redeveloped; and (3) recommendations on operational efficiencies that the government can realize in its operation and maintenance of such properties. The OMB shall review agency recommendations, develop standards for reviewing such recommendations, and submit such standards and its recommendations to the Board. The OMB shall incorporate specified factors in developing such standards, including the extent and timing of potential costs and savings beginning with the date of completion of the proposed recommendation, the economic impact on existing communities in the vicinity of the civilian real property, and the extent to which:  the civilian real property could be used to produce the highest and best value and return for the taxpayer;  the operating and maintenance costs are reduced through consolidating, co-locating, and reconfiguring space and through realizing other operational efficiencies;  the utilization rate is being maximized and is consistent with nongovernmental industry standards;  reliance on leasing for long-term space needs is reduced;  a civilian real property aligns with the current mission of the agency;  there are opportunities to consolidate similar operations across or within agencies;  energy consumption is reduced; and  public access to agency services is maintained or enhanced.  Standards developed by OMB shall incorporate and apply clear standard utilization rates to the extent that such rates increase efficiency and provide performance data. The utilization rates shall be consistent throughout each applicable category of space and with nongovernment space utilization rates. To the extent the space utilization rate of a given agency exceeds the utilization rates to be applied under this bill, the OMB may recommend realignment, co-location, consolidation, or other action to improve space utilization. (Sec. 12) The Board shall: (1) identify at least five federal civilian properties not on the list of surplus or excess properties that have a total fair market value of not less than $500 million and not more than $750 million, (2) transmit a list of such properties to the OMB and Congress as Board recommendations, (3) analyze the inventory of federal civilian real property and the associated agency recommendations, (4) implement an accounting system to evaluate the cost of and returns on recommendations (under which the Board shall set a standard performance period of not less than 15 years), and (5) report its conclusions and recommendations to the OMB. The Board's first report shall include transactions valued, in total, at not more than $2.5 billion and its second report shall include transactions valued, in total, at not more than $4.75 billion. (Sec. 13) The OMB shall: (1) review Board recommendations and transmit to the Board and Congress a report on its approval or disapproval of such recommendations, and (2) report information about the properties involved to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  (Sec. 14) Each agency shall: (1) submit a report of excess to the GSA regarding the federal civilian properties for which recommendations have been approved (which properties shall be sold by the GSA within one year for fair market value at highest and best use), (2) immediately begin preparation to carry out the Board's recommendations after the OMB transmits such recommendations to Congress, (3) initiate all activities necessary for implementation of such recommendations not later than two years after such transmittal, and (4) complete implementation within six years after transmittal unless extenuating circumstances prevent timely completion.  HUD shall identify any suitable properties for use as a property benefitting the mission of assistance to the homeless for the purposes of further screening pursuant to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The OMB may exclude from the Board's recommendations properties that are not suitable to benefit the homeless but that the OMB determines are suitable for use as a state or local public park or recreation area. The bill permits the transfer of federal civilian property only if: (1) the disposing agency certifies that the costs of all environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance activities otherwise to be paid by the agency with respect to the property equal or exceed the fair market value of the property; or (2) such costs are lower than the fair market value of the property and the recipient agrees to pay the difference. The agency may pay a recipient the amount by which such environmental costs exceed the property's fair market value. (Sec. 15) The bill authorizes specified sums to be appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Board and sums to be deposited into the Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund for activities related to the implementation of the Board's recommendations.  (Sec. 16) There is established in the Treasury the Public Buildings Reform Board Salaries and Expenses Account and the Public Buildings Reform Board--Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund. (Sec. 17) The GSA shall include, among other requirements for transmission to Congress of a prospectus of a proposed facility, a statement of how the proposed project is consistent with the standards and criteria developed under this bill. (Sec. 18) Actions taken pursuant to provisions of this bill regarding Board duties and OMB review, and actions of the Board, are not subject to judicial review. (Sec. 19) The Government Accountability Office shall annually review and report to Congress on agency implementation activities under this bill. (Sec. 20) After termination of the Board, the net proceeds from the transfer of excess real property to another federal agency or from the sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus real property shall be deposited into the real property account of the agency that had custody of the real property at the time it was determined to be excess. Such proceeds may be expended only as authorized in annual appropriations Acts. Any net proceeds that are not expended shall be used for deficit reduction. Any net proceeds not obligated within three years after the date of deposit and not expended within five years after such date shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.  (Sec. 21) The GSA shall: (1) publish a database of all federal real property under the custody and control of all executive agencies, other than federal real property excluded for reasons of national security, and (2) make such database available to other federal agencies and accessible by the public at no cost through GSA's website.  (Sec. 22) The bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to allow the use of surplus property to provide permanent housing with or without supportive services to assist the homeless. (Sec. 23) The GSA, in determining whether a museum is attended by the public and therefore eligible, as a nonprofit, tax-exempt educational or public health institution or organization, to receive donated federal surplus property, shall consider the museum to be public if it, at a minimum, accedes to any request submitted for access during business hours. (Sec. 24) The bill directs the GSA, by December 31, 2018, to sell, at fair market value at highest and best use: (1) a specified property bounded by 12th Street, Independence Avenue, C Street, and the James Forrestal Building in Southwest Washington, D.C.; and (2) the building known as the Cotton Annex in Southwest Washington, D.C. Any net proceeds received shall be paid into the Federal Buildings Fund and may be expended only subject to a specific future appropriation.",

Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016  (Sec. 3) This bill directs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to identify annually a list of postal properties with space available for use by executive agencies and submit such list to specified congressional committees by September 30. This list shall also be provided to each federal agency for review and for making recommendations for collocations.  The bill establishes a Federal Real Property Council, to be chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to: (1) develop guidance and ensure implementation of an efficient and effective real property management strategy, (2) identify opportunities for the federal government to better manage its property and assets, and (3) reduce the costs of managing federal properties.  The council must update annually a real property management plan template with government-wide performance measures to reduce surplus property or achieve better utilization of underutilized property. The evaluation criteria must: (1) enable Congress and federal agencies to track their progress on a government-wide basis, and (2) allow for comparison of the performance of federal agencies against industry and other public sector agencies. The council must: (1) develop utilization rates consistent throughout each category of space and consistent with nongovernmental space use rates, (2) develop a strategy to reduce the reliance of federal agencies on leased space for long-term needs if ownership would be less costly, (3) provide guidance on eliminating inefficiencies in the federal leasing process, (4) compile a list of field offices suitable for collocation, and (5) develop guidelines for the use of public-private partnerships in the management of federal property. For five years, the council must report annually to the OMB on: (1) a list of the remaining excess property that is real property, surplus property that is real property, and underutilized property of each federal agency; (2) the council's progress in developing guidelines for agencies to assess their properties; (3) the progress of agencies in reducing excess and underutilized real property; (4) legislative recommendations; and (5) a list of entities that are consulted. The council must consult with: (1) state, local, and tribal authorities and other affected communities; and (2) private sector and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in transportation, commercial real estate, historic preservation, and homeless housing. The council must annually provide the real property management plan template and required reports to specified congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office. Federal agencies with independent leasing authority shall annually submit to the council a list of all leases currently in effect. This requirement shall not apply to the USPS or any other property excluded for national security reasons.  (Sec. 4) The USPS shall: (1) maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for postal properties, and (2) develop workforce projections to assess the property-related needs of the USPS workforce.  The USPS may develop a five-year management template to: (1) reduce excess and underutilized property; (2) adopt workplace practices, configurations, and management techniques that decrease the need for real property assets; (3) identify leased space that is not fully used or occupied; and (4) secure mail processing operations.  If the USPS develops such template, it shall conduct on a regular basis and report on an inventory of postal property that is real property. (Sec. 5) The USPS inspector general must report on excess property held by the USPS and recommendations for repurposing such property and increasing collocation with other federal agencies.  (Sec. 6) The bill expands the duties of federal agencies, with respect to the use of federal real property, to require: (1) workforce projections to assess the property-related requirements of the federal workforce, (2) the establishment of goals and priorities to reduce excess and underutilized property, (3) assessments of leased space to identify space that is not fully used or occupied, and (4) an annual inventory of real property under agency control and an assessment of the condition of such property.  (Sec. 7) The bill amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act to: (1) require the President to appoint specified members of the Public Buildings Reform Board recommended by (currently in consultation with) the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the the minority leaders of the House and the Senate; and (2) require the sale by the General Services Administration of specified property in southwest Washington, D.C., to ensure continuity of security measures, parking access, and infrastructure requirements of the James Forrestal Building while it is occupied by the Department of Energy.",

                "summary": "Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 or the PIPES Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill reauthorizes through FY2019 the gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and related programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT), including Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) operational expenses, one-call notification programs, community pipeline safety information grants, and the pipeline integrity program.  (Sec. 3) The DOT Inspector General shall report to DOT, PHMSA, and Congress a list of each statutory pipeline safety mandate contained in the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, as well as those pipeline safety statutory mandates contained in this Act and other prior Acts, that have not been implemented. DOT shall periodically report to Congress on specific actions taken to implement such mandates and make such report publicly available on its website. (Sec. 4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall report to Congress on the natural gas integrity management and hazardous liquid integrity management programs. (Sec. 6) Two of the individuals selected for each Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and each Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee must be state officials (currently, state commissioners). DOT must consult with national organizations representing commissioners (as under current law) or governors before making such a selection. DOT shall fill all vacancies on technical safety standards committees within 90 days of enactment of this bill, and after that period, not later than 60 days after a vacancy occurs. (Sec. 7) After completion of any PHMSA pipeline safety inspection, the PHMSA, or the certified state authority, shall:  conduct a post-inspection briefing with the gas or hazardous liquid pipeline owner or operator outlining any concerns, and give the owner or operator written preliminary findings of the inspection.   (Sec. 8) The GAO shall study improving existing damage prevention programs through technological improvements in location and communications practices to prevent excavation damage to a pipe or its coating. (Sec. 9) The DOT Inspector General shall review PHMSA staff resource management, including any recommendations to address hiring challenges, training needs, and any other staff resource challenges. (Sec. 10) DOT shall convene a working group to consider development of a voluntary information sharing system to encourage collaborative efforts to improve inspection information feedback and information sharing regarding natural gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipeline integrity risk analysis. (Sec. 11) DOT shall establish a national integrated pipeline safety regulatory inspection database to improve communication and collaboration between the PHMSA and state pipeline regulators. (Sec. 12) DOT shall issue minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities. A state authority may adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for such facilities if they are compatible with the minimum standards. The bill imposes a fee on the operator of an underground natural gas storage facility, and establishes the Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility Safety Account in the Pipeline Safety Fund to receive such fees. (Sec. 13) DOT shall allow for a state authority with a pipeline safety program certification, at its request, to participate in the inspection of an interstate pipeline facility.  (Sec. 14) Each hazardous liquid pipeline owner or operator shall provide safety data sheets on any spilled oil to the designated federal On-Scene Coordinator and state officials within six hours of notice of a spill to the National Response Center. (Sec. 15) DOT shall issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to take public comment on the petition for rulemaking dated October 28, 2015, titled \"Corrections to title 49 CFR 172.336 identification numbers; special provisions\" (P-1667), regarding the display of hazardous materials identification numbers on transport vehicles or freight containers. (Sec. 16) DOT may issue an emergency order, without prior notice or hearing, for an unsafe condition or practice, or combination thereof, constituting or causing an imminent hazard. (Sec. 17) The bill revises DOT authority to withhold any part of a payment from a state authority under a state pipeline safety grant if the state authority is not maintaining a satisfactory effort to carry out a safety program or is not acting satisfactorily as an agent.  DOT may, if a state certification is rejected or otherwise suspended or interrupted, use any unobligated or deobligated grant funds to carry out pipeline safety activities in that state. (Sec. 18) Each hazardous liquid pipeline owner or operator required to prepare a response plan shall consider the impact of a discharge into or on navigable waters or adjoining shorelines, including those covered by ice. (Sec. 19) DOT shall revise certain regulations to state explicitly that the Great Lakes and any marine coastal waters (including coastal estuaries) are USA ecological resources for purposes of determining whether a pipeline is in a high consequence area. (Sec. 20) The DOT Inspector General shall report to Congress on the community pipeline safety technical assistance grants program. (Sec. 21) The GAO shall study materials, training, and corrosion prevention technologies used in pipeline transportation. (Sec. 22) The GAO shall report to Congress on PHMSA's research and development program for pipeline facility integrity. Certain DOT biennial reporting requirements regarding gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety are revised to require an analysis and evaluation of each R&amp;D pipeline facility integrity project using federal and non-federal entities as well as a review of how the project affects safety. The bill amends the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 to revise requirements for the allocation of funding costs of pipeline transportation R&amp;D using non-federal sources. DOT shall implement processes and procedures to ensure that such projects produce results that are factual and peer-reviewed by independent experts. (Sec. 23) DOT shall issue formal guidance to gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility owners and operators and state regulatory authorities regarding actions required to change the status of a pipeline facility from active to abandoned. (Sec. 24) The GAO shall complete a study on state pipeline safety agreements within two years of the enactment of this bill.",
