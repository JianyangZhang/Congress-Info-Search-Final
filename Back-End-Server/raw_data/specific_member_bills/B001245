NOAA must submit a report to Congress describing all activities undertaken to implement the strategy. Additionally, NOAA is authorized to: (1) make community-based planning grants for increased protection of high priority coral reefs, (2) maintain an inventory of all coral reef vessel groundings, (3) identify all coral reefs with a high incidence of vessel impacts, and (4) identify measures to reduce such impacts. NOAA must also submit an international coral reef ecosystem strategy to Congress and may establish an international coral reef ecosystem partnership program.The international strategy must be published in the Federal Register. The bill establishes the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to coordinate federal actions that are designed to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. Additionally, the 12 federal agencies on the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force are authorized to carry out either individually or cooperatively, prize competitions that promote coral reef research and conservation.",

NOAA and other federal and state agencies are given the authority to enforce those laws, including enforcement through vessel forfeiture and civil and criminal penalties. NOAA may: (1) help other nations combat IUU fishing and achieve sustainable fisheries; (2) disclose information to government agencies, international fisheries management organizations, and foreign governments to enforce or assist in enforcing fisheries policies; and (3) publish a list of vessels and vessel owners engaged in IUU fishing and take action against listed vessels and owners. This bill subjects a nation to sanctions only if NOAA certifies that the nation is not addressing IUU fishing or activities resulting in bycatch of a protected living marine resource. Currently, such nations are subject to denial of port privileges and other sanctions unless NOAA has certified that they are addressing such activities.   NOAA must consider the activity of vessels of a nation in the last three years when identifying a nation as having vessels engaged in IUU fishing. Currently, NOAA considers only more recent activity.  (Sec. 112) This bill amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to expand enforcement authority to include violations of a treaty or binding conservation measure. TITLE II--IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANTIGUA CONVENTION Antigua Convention Implementing Act of 2015 (Sec. 202) This bill amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to implement the Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission Established by the 1949 Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica, also known as the Antigua Convention.

Directs Commerce to prevent a person from violating those Acts in the same manner as though specified enforcement provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act had been incorporated into each Act, including civil and criminal penalties, permit sanctions, and civil forfeiture procedures. Sets forth additional enforcement authorities relating to searches and seizures, inspections, shipment detentions, the carrying of firearms, arrests, and the execution of subpoenas.  Authorizes Commerce to: (1) engage in international cooperation to help other nations combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and achieve sustainable fisheries; and (2) disclose certain enforcement information to state or federal agencies or internationally to ensure compliance with measures Commerce enforces, including international fishery agreements to which the United States is a party. Directs Commerce to take actions to improve the effectiveness of arrangements made pursuant to an international fishery agreement. Authorizes: (1) the development and publication of a list of vessels engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing (IUU) or fishing-related activities in support of IUU, including vessels or vessel owners identified by an international fishery management organization or arrangement made pursuant to an international fishery agreement; and (2) taking action against listed vessels. Revises certain sanctions, including denying port privileges and prohibition of fish and fish product importation, if Commerce has not yet issued a positive certification regarding whether a nation's nationals or vessels engage in IUU.  Requires Commerce to identify in reports on international compliance nations that: (1) violate conservation and management measures required under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party, or (2) fail to effectively address or regulate IUU. Applies the provisions of the Act that apply to nations to other entities that have competency to enter into international fishery management agreements as appropriate.  Authorizes appropriations through FY2019 for enforcement of the fishery laws mentioned in this title and for the identification of those nations.  (Sec. 102) Amends the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act to require denial of port privileges and other sanctions for large-scale driftnet fishing vessels of a nation that receives a negative IUU or conservation certification. (Sec. 107) Amends the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 remove a requirement that, in order to be a violation of the Act, a person knew, or reasonably should have known, that an Antarctic marine living resource was harvested in violation of the Act. (Sec. 108) Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 to remove a requirement for Commerce to submit an annual report on the conservation and management of highly migratory species.  (Sec. 109) Amends the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 to void high seas fishing permits if any other required permit or authorization is expired, revoked, or suspended or if the vessel is no longer documented under U.S. laws or eligible for the documentation. (Sec. 113) Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to make it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any fish taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any treaty or in contravention of any binding conservation measure adopted by an international agreement or organization to which the United States is a party.  Title II: Implementation of the Antigua Convention - (Sec. 202) Antigua Convention Implementing Act of 2011 [sic] - Amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to revise provisions regarding: (1) the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, (2) the General Advisory Committee, (3) the Scientific Advisory Subcommittee, and (4) enforcement. Repeals the Eastern Pacific Tuna Licensing Act of 1984. Title III: Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing - Port State Measures Agreement Act of 2014 - Authorizes Commerce to promulgate regulations to carry out the implementation of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, done at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in Rome, Italy, November 22, 2009, and signed by the United States November 22, 2009. (The Agreement provides tools for nations to address IUU fishing and to prevent IUU-caught fish from entering markets and competing with legally-caught fish. It recognizes that all seafood must pass through a port to get to market and allows nations to use inspections to prevent IUU fish from reaching the market.)",
