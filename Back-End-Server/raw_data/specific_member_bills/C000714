The determination must be based on:   an evaluation of the published and peer-reviewed scientific evidence on whether the use or uses of those neonicotinoids cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators, including native bees, honeybees, birds, bats, and other species of beneficial insects; and  a completed field study that meets the criteria required by the EPA and evaluates residues, chronic low-dose exposure, and cumulative effects of multiple chemical exposures.  The EPA may not issue new registrations of the neonicotinoid pesticides for any seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee-attractive plants, trees, and cereals under FIFRA until it has made the determination with respect to the insecticide. For purposes of protecting and ensuring the long-term viability of native bees and other pollinators, the Department of the Interior must: (1) regularly monitor the health and population status of native bees, (2) identify the scope and likely causes of unusual native bee mortality, and (3) submit to Congress and make public an annual report on the health and population status of native bees.",

Financial incentives between HMOs and physicians based on utilization are prohibited.  The program is funded: (1) from existing sources of government revenues for health care, (2) by increasing personal income taxes on the top 5% of income earners, (3) by instituting a progressive excise tax on payroll and self-employment income, (4) by instituting a tax on unearned income, and (5) by instituting a tax on stock and bond transactions. Amounts that would have been appropriated for federal public health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), are transferred and appropriated to carry out this bill. The program must give employment transition benefits and first priority in retraining and job placement to individuals whose jobs are eliminated due to reduced clerical and administrative work under this bill.

Labor is required, through studies it conducts or through independent studies, to:  review the effectiveness of job training and job creation programs under this bill, disseminate information concerning best practices for achieving the bill's goals, and acquire a better understanding of such programs' true cost.  Arbitration procedures are established for resolution of disputes for grant recipients. Labor is required to post a whistleblower hotline on its website for the public to report noncompliance with the bill's requirements.  Labor must convene an annual national employment conference to discuss this bill's role in addressing all aspects of unemployment problems, the sharing of best practices in addressing them, and the discussion of problems in the administration of this bill. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is amended to revise member composition requirements for state and local workforce development boards to include at least 25% of the chief executive officers of minority-serving, community-based organizations. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to impose a tax on the transfer of ownership in certain covered securities transactions, payable by trading facilities or brokers that deal in such transactions. A penalty is imposed against persons who fail to include such transactions on any tax return or statement. Labor shall suspend new hiring of unemployed persons and freeze the hourly wages paid for jobs funded under this bill whenever it is determined that:  the unemployment rate is less than 4%, and the consumer price index (inflation) is greater than 3%.",
