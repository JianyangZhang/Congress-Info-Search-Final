This bill amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to make environmental impact statements for major federal actions (excluding actions related to gaming) on Indian lands available only to certain entities.  The bill sets forth provisions for the judicial review of a cause of action related to energy development on Indian land. This bill amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to direct Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to enter into agreements with Indian tribes to carry out demonstration projects that promote biomass energy production. Interior and USDA may carry out demonstration projects by which tribes may perform the functions of programs under that Act.  Activity pursuant to a tribal resource management plan approved by Interior is considered to be a sustainable management practice. This bill amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to revise the types and duration of leases the Navajo Nation may enter without Interior's approval.

To distinguish between fish that are depleted due to fishing and those that are depleted for other reasons, the term \"depleted\" replaces the term \"overfished\" throughout the MSA. Fishery impact statements must analyze the impacts of proposed actions in fishery management plans on the quality of the human environment.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must publish a plan for implementing the Cooperative Research and Management Program.  The offshore jurisdiction of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama is extended from three miles to nine miles for the recreational management of red snapper. The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission must conduct all fishery stock assessments used for management purposes by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council for the fisheries managed under the Council's Reef Fish Management Plan. Any commercial catch share allocation in a fishery in the Gulf of Mexico may only be traded by sale or lease within the same commercial fishing sector.
