Taxpayer rights include the right to be informed, the right to quality service, the right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax, the right to challenge the position of the IRS and to be heard, the right to appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum, the right to finality, the right to privacy, the right to confidentiality, the right to retain representation, and the right to a fair and just tax system, including access to the National Taxpayer Advocate.  TITLE II--PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS The IRS must establish a Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program (VITA grant program) for the development, expansion, or continuation of qualified return preparation programs assisting low-income taxpayers and members of underserved populations. The National Center to Promote Quality, Excellence, and Evaluation in Volunteer Income Tax Assistance is established to: (1) promote the adoption of a universally accessible volunteer training platform for the preparation of federal income tax returns, (2) provide technical assistance to tax return preparation program managers, (3) identify and disseminate best practices related to tax site management, (4) support outreach and marketing efforts, and (5) provide for the evaluation of programs and activities funded under this title. This title: (1) grants Treasury the authority to regulate paid tax return preparers and to sanction them for incompetence or misconduct; (2) imposes or increases penalties on tax return preparers for understating taxpayer liability, gross misconduct, and other violations; (3) permits enrolled agents who represent taxpayers before the IRS to use the designation \"enrolled agent,\" \"EA,\" or \"E.A.\"; and (4) limits the disclosure of taxpayer information to the express purpose for which the taxpayer granted consent. TITLE III--IMPROVING IRS PROCEDURES  This title revises IRS procedures for filing a notice of lien to: (1) require the IRS to consider the compliance history of the taxpayer and the economic impact of a tax lien on the taxpayer, and (2) limit IRS authority to attach retirement accounts.  This title amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to reduce from seven years to two years the period that a tax lien may appear on a taxpayer's credit report.  This title provides for de novo review by the Tax Court of IRS innocent spouse relief determinations.  The IRS must: (1) develop annual training for all IRS officers and employees regarding taxpayer rights, the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate's case criteria and mission, and Taxpayer Assistance Order procedures; (2) provide taxpayers with notice and an opportunity to be heard if the IRS Office of Appeals issues a notice of deficiency; and (3) assign one appeals officer and one settlement agent from the Office of Appeals to each state. TITLE IV--NATIONAL TAXPAYER ADVOCATE This title grants the National Taxpayer Advocate the authority to: (1) appeal a modification or rescission of a Taxpayer Assistance Order by an IRS Deputy Commissioner to the IRS Commissioner for a final determination; (2) inspect taxpayer administrative files in the performance of its duties; (3) issue a Taxpayer Advocate Directive to improve IRS operations and to protect the rights of groups of taxpayers (or all taxpayers); and (4) designate essential employees to assist taxpayers during any lapse in appropriations for the IRS.",

Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to: (1) report to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a plan for conducting fraud and error prevention activities; (2) take any necessary actions to ensure that cooperative disability investigations (CDI) units have been established for each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories; (3) conduct quality reviews in certain cases with respect to decisions in connection with the application for benefits under this title and SSAct title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI), in a sufficient number to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and other guidance issued by the Commissioner; (4) report annually to Congress the total number of cases selected for such quality review, the number of such cases in which a decision is remanded, and the number of such cases in which a decision is modified or reversed; and (5) report annually to Congress on the number of work-related continuing disability reviews conducted. Allows the Commissioner to submit a combined annual report to specified congressional committees of certain information relating to disability benefits.  Increases civil and criminal penalties for specified persons in positions of trust in certain cases of fraud, and requires inflation adjustments every four years for certain civil penalties. Prohibits the Commissioner, in making any determination with respect to whether an individual is or continues to be under a disability, from considering (except for good cause) any evidence furnished by a physician or other health care provider who has been barred from practice, has been assessed a penalty for the submission of false evidence, or is excluded from participation in any federal health care program..
