Before issuing any guidance, order, rule, or regulation, the CFPB shall consider the OEA's review and assessment of it, giving notice and explanation if the CFPB disagrees with the OEA. The CFPB shall also, in each proposed rulemaking, identify the problem the particular rule or regulations is seeking to solve, and specify the metrics by which success in solving the problem will be measured.",
