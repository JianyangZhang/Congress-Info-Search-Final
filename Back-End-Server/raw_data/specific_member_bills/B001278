The bill also amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate refund anticipation payment arrangements. A refund anticipation payment arrangement is an arrangement under which, in exchange for tax preparation services, a taxpayer agrees to pay a fee or interest upon receipt of a tax refund to a preparer or lender either by: (1) requesting the federal government to deposit a tax refund, or a portion of the refund, into an account; or (2) directly paying the preparer or lender.  The CFPB shall require tax return preparers offering a refund anticipation payment arrangement to provide a disclosure statement to a consumer about the arrangement and shall promulgate regulations that require preparers to comply with the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act.  Finally, the bill allows an income tax refund requested on a tax return prepared by an income tax preparer to be split between the preparer and the taxpayer and prohibits the treatment of such a split as disreputable conduct merely because the taxpayer requested such split.",

DIVISION C--INCREASING CHOICE, ACCESS, AND QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICANS Increasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans Act TITLE XV--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART A  (Sec. 15001) The bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop, with respect to claims for hospital services, codes under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) for similar inpatient and outpatient hospital services. (Sec. 15002) The bill establishes processes for adjusting a hospital's Medicare payments based on the hospital's overall proportion of inpatients who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. (Sec. 15003) The bill extends for five years the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program, through which Medicare pays certain rural hospitals on the basis of reasonable incurred costs rather than under the standard prospective payment system. (Sec. 15004) With respect to long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), the bill lifts a moratorium on bed increases. The bill reduces rates for high-cost outlier payments, which are additional Medicare payments made in extraordinarily high-cost cases. (Sec. 15005) The bill reduces the amount by which hospital payment rates for inpatient services increase in FY2018.  (Sec. 15006) The bill amends the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 to revise the applicability of certain Medicare payment rules exempting LTCHs from negative payment adjustments for admissions from certain co-located hospitals beyond specified thresholds. These rules shall apply for an additional period beginning on October 1, 2016. (Sec. 15007) In addition, the bill amends the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 to expand to all LTCHs the application of a payment rule that requires the exclusion of certain patients for purposes of calculating length of stay. Under current law, the payment rule applies only to a hospital that was classified as an LTCH as of a specified date. (Sec. 15008) The bill removes certain hospitals specializing in neoplastic disease from their classification as LTCHs for purposes of Medicare payment.  (Sec. 15009) With specified exceptions, current law applies certain payment limits to inpatient services for LTCHs that do not meet specified discharge requirements. The bill: (1) establishes a new temporary exception to these limits for certain spinal cord specialty hospitals, and (2) expands an existing temporary exception with respect to certain discharges involving severe wounds. TITLE XVI--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART B  (Sec. 16001) The bill excludes certain off-campus outpatient departments (OPDs) from specified rules that mandate lower Medicare payments. Specifically, the exclusion applies to: (1) cancer hospitals in off-campus OPDs, and (2) mid-build OPDs. A \"mid-build\" OPD is one for which the provider had, before a certain date, a binding written agreement with an outside party for construction. (Sec. 16003) With respect to payment reductions for failing to meet requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records, the bill exempts eligible professionals who are based in ambulatory surgical centers.  (Sec. 16004) The bill requires the CMS to continue to instruct Medicare contractors not to enforce requirements for direct physician supervision of outpatient therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals through 2016. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must report on the effect of extending this instruction on: (1) Medicare beneficiaries, and (2) hospital staffing needs. (Sec. 16005) The bill amends the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act to delay by six months the implementation of specified Medicare fee schedule adjustments with respect to certain accessories and seating systems used with complex rehabilitation technology wheelchairs.  (Sec. 16006) The bill allows physical therapists to utilize \"locum tenens\" arrangements (through which a substitute practitioner is retained when the regular practitioner is absent for a reason such as illness or pregnancy) under Medicare in the same manner as physicians are allowed to use utilize such arrangements under current law.  (Sec. 16007) The CMS shall: (1) delay by six months the full implementation of new Medicare payment rates for durable medical equipment (DME), and (2) study and report on the impact of applicable payment adjustments on the availability of DME to Medicare beneficiaries.  (Sec. 16008) Under current law, the CMS must use payment information from competitive acquisition programs to make payment adjustments for DME items furnished in areas outside of such programs. Current law also allows, but does not require, the CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics (such as splints and braces) and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies (such as feeding tubes). The bill requires the CMS, in making these adjustments, to account for stakeholder input. In addition, the CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors:  average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services,  average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and  number of suppliers.  TITLE XVII--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS  (Sec. 17001) Until plan year 2019, the CMS may not terminate a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating. (Sec. 17002) The CMS must annually report on specified Medicare enrollment data. (Sec. 17003) The CMS shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the Welcome to Medicare package, and (2) update the information included in the package accordingly.  (Sec. 17004) Current law allows the CMS to impose a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new providers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse. With specified exceptions, the bill prohibits payment under these programs to new providers in areas subject to such temporary moratorium.  (Sec. 17005) The bill expands and modifies enrollment and disenrollment options for MA-eligible individuals. Specifically, the bill extends the annual period in which an individual enrolled in MA may elect to instead receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as elect to change qualified prescription drug coverage. Furthermore, any MA-eligible individual (whether or not enrolled in MA) may once per period change a previous election with respect to receiving benefits through MA or Medicare FFS, including changing from one MA plan to another. Unsolicited marketing during this period is prohibited.  (Sec. 17006) The bill allows individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for MA. Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible. With respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's FFS program, and (2) excludes such costs from the calculation of certain benchmarks that form the basis for payment under MA plans. The CMS must conduct, and post online the results of, an evaluation of whether to include in a plan's quality rating a measure specifically related to care for MA enrollees with ESRD. The bill also modifies risk adjustment with respect to MA plans. Specifically, in making such adjustments, the CMS must:  take into account an MA enrollee's total number of diseases or conditions,  use at least two years of diagnostic data,  provide separate adjustments for individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and  evaluate whether other specified factors should be included in the risk adjustment model.  (Sec. 17007) The bill establishes additional requirements for assigning Medicare FFS beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare shared savings program. (The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.) Specifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics. TITLE XVIII--OTHER PROVISIONS  (Sec. 18001) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and other laws to exempt qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) from certain requirements that apply to group health plans.  A qualified small employer HRA is offered by employers that have fewer than 50 full-time employees and do not offer group health plans to any of their employees. A qualified small employer HRA must:   be provided on the same terms to all eligible employees of the employer;  be funded solely by the employer without salary reduction contributions;  provide, after an employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses of the employee and family members; and  limit annual payments and reimbursements to specified dollar amounts.   HRAs that meet these requirements are not considered group health plans and are exempt from various requirements that apply to group health plans, including coverage and cost-sharing requirements. (Under current law, employers that sponsor group health plans that do not meet specified requirements are subject to an excise tax.)  Coverage and payments under a qualified HRA are excluded from gross income, unless the employee does not have minimum essential coverage for the month in which the medical care was provided. Employers offering a qualified HRA must notify employees in advance regarding permitted benefits and report benefit information on W-2 forms and to health exchanges.  The bill sets forth requirements for determining whether an employee covered under an HRA is also eligible for premium subsidies under PPACA. ",

A remotely created check is a paper or electronic check that:  is not created by the financial institution that holds the customer account from which the check is to be paid; and does not bear a signature applied, or purported to be applied, by the account holder.  A consumer may revoke authorization for remotely created checks at any time.  The bill prohibits issuance of any payment order in response to a consumer's exercise of federal consumer financial rights. Any voluntary electronic fund transfer to repay a small-dollar consumer credit transaction shall be treated as preauthorized under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The TILA is amended to require registration with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by any small-dollar lender that facilitates, brokers, arranges, or gathers applications for small-dollar consumer credit (of up to $5,000, adjusted for inflation) extended pursuant to an open-end, non-open-end, or other CFPB-determined credit plan meeting specified criteria. Small-dollar consumer credit transactions must comply with state law where the consumer resides. The EFTA is amended to:  declare unlawful overdraft fees charged on a general-use prepaid card, and authorize the CFPB to prohibit fees for declined transactions involving such a card.   The TILA is further amended to prohibit a person from certain activities, including distributing sensitive personal financial information, in connection with a small-dollar consumer credit transaction, if that person (\"lead generator\") does not itself grant the credit directly to the consumer. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall study: (1) the availability of capital on Indian reservations, and (2) the impact on tribal economic opportunity and wealth of small-dollar consumer credit extensions to tribal members through Internet and non-Internet means.",
