                "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Highlights:  This bill provides FY2018 appropriations for:    the Department of Labor;   most of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS);   the Department of Education (ED); and   several related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the National Labor Relations Board.   The bill does not include funding for the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which are included within HHS, but considered in other appropriations bills. The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The majority of the funding in the bill is mandatory funding for entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income that are funded in annual appropriations bills. These programs, known as appropriated entitlements, are included in annual appropriations bills, though the amounts provided for the programs are generally determined by authorizing statutes that control details of the programs such as eligibility rules and benefit levels.  The bill decreases discretionary funding compared to FY2017 levels. It also includes provisions that affect polices in areas such as:    implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,   abortion,   human embryo research,   fiduciary standards for providing investment advice for pension and retirement plans,   collective bargaining, and   needle exchange programs.   Full Summary:  Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018  Provides FY2018 appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and several related agencies.

Provides appropriations to the Employment and Training Administration for:    Training and Employment Services,   the Job Corps,   Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances,   State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations,   Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds, and   Program Administration.   Provides appropriations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  Provides appropriation to Labor for:    the Employee Benefits Security Administration,   the Wage and Hour Division,   the Office of Labor-Management Standards,   the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,   the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),   the Mine Safety and Health Administration,   the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and   the Office of Disability Employment Policy.   Provides appropriations for Departmental Management, including:   Salaries and Expenses, Veterans Employment and Training,   IT Modernization, and   the Office of Inspector General.   (Sec. 101) Prohibits Job Corps funds provided by this bill from being used to pay individual salary and bonuses at a rate in excess of Executive Level II.  (Sec. 102) Permits specified Labor funds to be transferred between accounts and sets forth requirements for the transfers.  (Sec. 103) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for the procurement of goods and services utilizing forced or indentured child labor.  (Sec. 104) Requires specified funds available for job training grants under the American Competitiveness and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to be used only for competitive grants to train individuals who are over the age of 16 and are not in school within a local educational agency in the occupations and industries for which employers are using H-1B visas to hire foreign workers, and the related activities necessary to support the training.  (Sec. 105) Prohibits a recipient of Employment and Training Administration (ETA) funds from using the funds to pay the salary and bonuses of an individual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II, with an exception for vendors providing goods and services. Permits states to establish lower limits for salaries and bonuses.  (Sec. 106) Permits the ETA to: (1) transfer funds provided for technical assistance services to grantees to Program Administration if the services will be more efficiently performed by federal employees, and (2) transfer specified Program Administration funds to carry out program integrity activities.  (Sec. 107) Limits the funds that may be reserved for evaluation of programs and activities and requires the Chief Evaluation Officer to submit a plan to Congress in advance of transferring funds to be used for evaluations.  (Sec. 108) Permits Labor to select an entity to operate a Civilian Conservation Center on a competitive basis if the center has had consistently low performance.

(Sec. 111) Provides employers in the seafood industry with flexibility with respect to bringing H-2B nonimmigrant workers into the United States. (The H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs.)  (Sec. 112) Sets forth requirements for determining the prevailing wage for the H-2B program.

(The rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans. Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The rule changed the definition of \"investment advice\" to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships.)

(Sec. 208) Specifies that no provider of services under title X of the PHS Act may be exempt from any state law requiring notification or the reporting of child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape, or incest.  (Sec. 209) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for the Medicare Advantage program if HHS denies participation to an otherwise eligible entity because it will not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or provide referrals for abortions.  (Sec. 210) Prohibits funds provided by this title from being used to advocate or promote gun control.

The bill grants the FDA regulatory authority over vapor products that is in addition to the FDA's existing authority to regulate vapor products as tobacco products. Provisions of the FFDCA applicable to tobacco product components also apply to vapor product batteries. The FDA must establish standards for vapor product batteries. Vapor products first marketed not later than 24 months after enactment of this bill are not subject to premarket review or reporting requirements based on changes to the product's battery to conform to standards. Vapor products may not be advertised in publications, except publications with adult readership. Vapor products may be sold only face-to-face, through vending machines in facilities where only adults are permitted, or by mail order.
