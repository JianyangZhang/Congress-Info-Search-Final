In applying this limitation, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall not take into account any such resident that is filling a GME residency position that counts towards meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) obligation under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to increase the number of GME residency positions at VA medical facilities by up to 1,500 positions. The period for increasing GME residency positions at VA medical facilities is extended to 10 years.  The VA and HHS shall jointly conduct a six-year pilot program to establish at least three graduate behavioral medicine residency programs in underserved areas in the United States.  Education and training of marriage and family therapists and licensed professional mental health counselors shall be included in VA health personnel education and training programs. Persons with a doctoral degree in mental health counseling are eligible for appointment to a VA mental health counselor position. Physician assistants in VA facilities must receive pay competitive with pay for similar positions in non-VA facilities in the same labor market. Not less than 30% of debt reduction payments paid under the education debt reduction program each year shall be paid to individuals who practice medicine in a rural or highly rural area.  The positions (and pay) of Directors of Veterans Integrated Service Networks are established.
